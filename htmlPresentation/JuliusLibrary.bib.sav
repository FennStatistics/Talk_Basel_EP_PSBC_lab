  abstract = {This article discusses causal analysis as a paradigm for explanation in sociology. It begins with a detailed analysis of causality statements in Durkheim's Le suicide. It then discusses the history of causality assumptions in sociological writing since the 1930s, with brief remarks about the related discipline of econometrics. The author locates the origins of causal argument in a generation of brilliant and brash young sociologists with a model and a mission and then briefly considers the history of causality concepts in modern philosophy. The article closes with reflections on the problems created for sociology by the presumption that causal accounting is the epitome of explanation within the discipline. It is argued that sociology should spend more effort on (and should better reward) descriptive work.},

  abstract = {The integrated assessment models (IAMs) that economists use to analyze the expected costs and benefits of climate policies frequently suggest that the ``optimal'' policy is to go slowly and to do relatively little in the near term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We trace this finding to the contestable assumptions and limitations of IAMs. For example, they typically discount future impacts from climate change at relatively high rates. This practice may be appropriate for short-term financial decisions but its extension to intergenerational environmental issues rests on several empirically and philosophically controversial hypotheses. IAMs also assign monetary values to the benefits of climate mitigation on the basis of incomplete information and sometimes speculative judgments concerning the monetary worth of human lives and ecosystems, while downplaying scientific uncertainty about the extent of expected damages. In addition, IAMs may exaggerate mitigation costs by failing to reflect the socially determined, path-dependent nature of technical change and ignoring the potential savings from reduced energy utilization and other opportunities for innovation. A better approach to climate policy, drawing on recent research on the economics of uncertainty, would reframe the problem as buying insurance against catastrophic, low-probability events. Policy decisions should be based on a judgment concerning the maximum tolerable increase in temperature and/or carbon dioxide levels given the state of scientific understanding. The appropriate role for economists would then be to determine the least-cost global strategy to achieve that target. While this remains a demanding and complex problem, it is far more tractable and epistemically defensible than the cost-benefit comparisons attempted by most IAMs.},

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

  author = {Akbik, Alan and Blythe, Duncan and Vollgraf, Roland},
  abstract = {Recent advances in language modeling using recurrent neural networks have made it viable to model language as distributions over characters. By learning to predict the next character on the basis of previous characters, such models have been shown to automatically internalize linguistic concepts such as words, sentences, subclauses and even sentiment. In this paper, we propose to leverage the internal states of a trained character language model to produce a novel type of word embedding which we refer to as contextual string embeddings. Our proposed embeddings have the distinct properties that they (a) are trained without any explicit notion of words and thus fundamentally model words as sequences of characters, and (b) are contextualized by their surrounding text, meaning that the same word will have different embeddings depending on its contextual use. We conduct a comparative evaluation against previous embeddings and find that our embeddings are highly useful for downstream tasks: across four classic sequence labeling tasks we consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art. In particular, we significantly outperform previous work on English and German named entity recognition (NER), allowing us to report new state-of-the-art F1-scores on the CONLL03 shared task.},

Using synthetic data sets, we illustrate under which conditions missing values introduce biases in the estimates of the relationship between class membership and auxiliary variables. We apply three-step LC analysis with both modal and proportional class assignments, as well as the recently proposed two-step LC analysis method.Our results show that stepwise LC analysis yields unbiased parameter values as long as the MAR assumption holds in the step-one model. When this assumption does not hold because covariates are omitted from the step-one model, each of the stepwise approaches yields some bias, but bias is much larger with modal class assignments. The amount of bias is affected by the amount of deviation from MAR, the proportion of missing values, and the separation between the classes.},

The first context is the person, as attitudes change in connection to values, general goals, language, emotions, and human development. The second context is social relationships, which link attitude change to the communicator of persuasive messages, social media, and culture. The third context is sociohistorical and highlights the influence of unique events, including sociopolitical, economic, and climatic occurrences. In conclusion, many important recent findings reflect the fact that holism, with a focus on situating attitudes within their personal, social, and historical contexts, has become the zeitgeist of attitude research during this period.},

A particularly advantageous way to study these systems is through the analysis of the networks that encode the interactions among the system constituents. During the past two decades, network science has provided many insights in natural, social, biological, and technological systems. However, real systems are often interconnected, with many interdependencies that are not properly captured by single-layer networks. To account for this source of complexity, a more general framework, in which different networks evolve or interact with each other, is needed. These are known as multilayer networks. Here, we provide an overview of the basic methodology used to describe multilayer systems as well as of some representative dynamical processes that take place on top of them. We round off the review with a summary of several applications in diverse fields of science.},

The results revealed a significant influence of thermal comfort (40\%) and aesthetics (22\%) on users' perspectives. The developed model was validated by experts working in the facility management field and they acknowledged it as having good potential. This work first utilized the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) modelling technique to determine weights for each factor and sub-factor and then employed the fuzzy expert system to develop an OUPS. Questionnaire responses and interviews with facility managers and users were used to develop these models for a case study of the M.B. building at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec.},

Nonetheless, pressure on decision-makers to find solutions to dangerous climate change is rising due to the inertia in the climate system. Considering these pressures, technological options (climate engineering) have been proposed to counteract the effects of climatic change. However, introducing options that bear their own scientific uncertainties means further adding to the complexity of the situation. By adopting the psychological perspective of complex problem solving research, we analyze one frequently neglected source of uncertainty with regard to climate engineering: errors of the political problem-solver in his interaction with the situational demands of complex problems. More specifically, we examine the psychological sources for human error that are common in dealing with the uncertainties implied in this type of problem. We will conclude from the complex problem solving perspective that a consideration of climate engineering in the context of climate change can provide a dangerous illusion of controllability.},

Unlike other text analytics publications, Practical Text Analytics: Maximizing the Value of Text Data makes technical concepts accessible to those without extensive experience in the field. Using text analytics, organizations can derive insights from content such as emails, documents, and social media. Practical Text Analytics is divided into five parts. The first part introduces text analytics, discusses the relationship with content analysis, and provides a general overview of text mining methodology. In the second part, the authors discuss the practice of text analytics, including data preparation and the overall planning process. The third part covers text analytics techniques such as cluster analysis, topic models, and machine learning. In the fourth part of the book, readers learn about techniques used to communicate insights from text analysis, including data storytelling. The final part of Practical Text Analytics offers examples of the application of software programs for text analytics, enabling readers to mine their own text data to uncover information.},

This study contributes to the literature on the impact of ethical judgements on the acceptance of ITDs by using a multidimensional ethical scale (MES) proposed by Shwayer and Sennetti. The novelty of this study resides in using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) instead of correlational methods to explain human behaviour (in this case, attitudes towards ITDs) from an ethical perspective. fsQCA evaluates the influence of ethical variables on the intention to use ITDs (and the non-use of these technologies). Positive ethical evaluations of technology do not always ensure ITD acceptance\textemdash unfavourable ethical perceptions may lead to its rejection. We find that for wearables: (1) positive perceptions from a utilitarian perspective are key in explaining their acceptance. Likewise, we identify configurations leading to acceptance where positive judgements on moral equity, egoism and contractualism are needed. Surprisingly, only the relativism dimension participates in configurations that cause acceptance when it is negated; (2) We found that a single unfavourable perception from a contractualism or relativism perspective causes non-use. Likewise, we found that coupling of negative judgements on moral equity, utilitarianism and egoism dimensions also produce resistance to wearables. For insideables, we notice that: (1) an MES has weak explanatory power for the intention to use ITDs but is effective in understanding resistance to use; (2) A negative perception of any ethical dimension leads to resistance towards insideables.},

Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.},

SEM trees build upon the decision tree paradigm by growing tree structures that divide a data set recursively into homogeneous subsets. In past research, SEM trees have been estimated predominantly with the R package semtree. The original algorithm in the semtree package selects split variables among covariates by calculating a likelihood ratio for each possible split of each covariate. Obtaining these likelihood ratios is computationally demanding. As a remedy, we propose to guide the construction of SEM trees by a family of score-based tests that have recently been popularized in psychometrics (Merkle and Zeileis, 2013; Merkle et al., 2014). These score-based tests monitor fluctuations in case-wise derivatives of the likelihood function to detect parameter differences between groups. Compared to the likelihood-ratio approach, score-based tests are computationally efficient because they do not require refitting the model for every possible split. In this paper, we introduce score-guided SEM trees, implement them in semtree, and evaluate their performance by means of a Monte Carlo simulation.},

The most often cited barriers in the literature were: scarcity, heterogeneity and complexity of ethical analysis methods; challenges in translating ethical analysis results into knowledge that is useful for decision makers; and lack of organizational support in terms of required expertise, time and financial resources. The most frequently cited facilitators included: usage of value-based appraisal methods, stakeholder and public engagement, enhancement of practice guidelines, ethical expertise, and educational interventions.Representatives of twenty-six (46.5 percent) agencies from nineteen countries completed the survey. A median of 10 percent (interquartile range, 5 percent to 50 percent) of the HTA products produced by the agencies was reported to include an assessment of ethical aspects. The most commonly perceived barriers were: limited ethical knowledge and expertise, insufficient time and resources, and difficulties in finding ethical evidence or using ethical guidelines. Educational interventions, demand by policy makers, and involvement of ethicists in HTA were the most commonly perceived facilitators.Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of simplification of ethics methodology and development of good practice guidelines in HTA, as well as capacity building for engaging HTA practitioners in ethical analyses.},

Therefore, each respondent gets only a subset of vignettes. These subsets may either be randomly selected in following the tradition of the factorial survey or systematically selected according to an experimental design. We show that these strategies in selecting vignette sets have strong implications for the analysis and interpretation of vignette data. Random selection strategies result in a random confounding of effects and heavily rely on the assumption of no interaction effects. In contrast, experimental strategies systematically confound interaction effects with main or set effects, thereby preserving a meaningful interpretation of main and important interaction effects. Using a pilot study on attitudes toward immigrants we demonstrate the implementation and analysis of a confounded factorial design. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Many criteria have been suggested to determine how many factors should be retained. In this study, we present an extensive Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the performance of extraction criteria under varying sample sizes, numbers of indicators per factor, loading magnitudes, underlying multivariate distributions of observed variables, as well as how the performance of the extraction criteria are influenced by the presence of cross-loadings and minor factors for unidimensional, orthogonal, and correlated factor models. We compared several variants of traditional parallel analysis (PA), the Kaiser-Guttman Criterion, and sequential {$\chi$}2 model tests (SMT) with 4 recently suggested methods: revised PA, comparison data (CD), the Hull method, and the Empirical Kaiser Criterion (EKC). No single extraction criterion performed best for every factor model. In unidimensional and orthogonal models, traditional PA, EKC, and Hull consistently displayed high hit rates even in small samples. Models with correlated factors were more challenging, where CD and SMT outperformed other methods, especially for shorter scales. Whereas the presence of cross-loadings generally increased accuracy, non-normality had virtually no effect on most criteria. We suggest researchers use a combination of SMT and either Hull, the EKC, or traditional PA, because the number of factors was almost always correctly retrieved if those methods converged. When the results of this combination rule are inconclusive, traditional PA, CD, and the EKC performed comparatively well. However, disagreement also suggests that factors will be harder to detect, increasing sample size requirements to N {$\geq$} 500. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Methods A multistage inventory-item development process was undertaken involving 93 pharmacists and using a previously described explanatory model for conflict in pharmacy practice. A 19-item inventory was developed, field tested, and validated. Results The conflict management scale (CMS) demonstrated an acceptable degree of reliability and validity for use in educational or practice settings to promote self-reflection and self-awareness regarding individuals' conflict management styles. Conclusions The CMS provides a unique, pharmacy-specific method for individuals to determine and reflect upon their own conflict management styles. As part of an educational program to facilitate self-reflection and heighten self-awareness, the CMS may be a useful tool to promote discussions related to an important part of pharmacy practice.},

I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score.

This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents' demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits. We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global, socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this article are publicly available.},

This raises the question of if and how both strategies interact. Although raised in many publications, there are surprisingly few detailed investigations of this important issue. The paper aims at contributing to closing this research gap by (i) reconstructing moral hazard claims to clarify their aim, (ii) offering one specific normative justification for far-reaching mitigation and (iii) investigating in greater detail different mechanisms that could potentially cause a trade-off between mitigation and SRM. I conclude that the empirical evidence questioning the trade-off hypothesis is inconclusive. Moreover, theoretical reflections as well as economic model studies point to a trade-off. In our current epistemic situation these findings must be taken seriously. They caution against researching and developing SRM technologies before measures to avoid or minimise a trade-off are implemented.},

Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity across and within measure categories (propensity, frequency, behaviour), domains (e.g., investment, occupational, alcohol consumption), and sample characteristics (e.g., age). Specifically, while self-reported propensity and frequency measures of risk preference show a higher degree of stability relative to behavioural measures, these patterns are moderated by domain and age. Crucially, an analysis of convergent validity reveals a low agreement across measures, questioning the idea that they capture the same underlying trait. Our results raise concerns about the coherence and measurement of the risk preference construct.},

Pairs of items were written to mimic item meaning similarities cited in the applied literature. Item order was experimentally manipulated such that pairs of items with similar meaning were presented either contiguously or randomly. Results indicated that items rated as most similar in meaning were more likely to exhibit correlated residuals, thus supporting the claim that meaning similarity is a driver of correlated residuals. However, randomly ordering items reduced the magnitude of correlated residuals and improved model-data fit relative to contiguous ordering. Implications of these results for those engaged in scale development and revision based on CFA results are discussed.},

There are many psychological studies that appear to have been harmful or cruel to the people or animals that~took part in them. For example, memory researchers carried out studies on a man who had no memory for over forty years, but because he had no memory he was never able to agree to the studies. Is this a reasonable thing to do to someone? Comparative psychologist Harry Harlow found that he could create severe and lasting distress in monkeys by keeping them in social isolation. Is this a reasonable thing to do even if we find out useful things about human distress? If you were able to use psychological techniques to break someone down so that they revealed information that was useful to your government, would you do it? If so,~why? If not, why not? These ethical issues are not easy to resolve and the debates continue as we encounter new dilemmas.

That approach, however, requires broad international cooperation and, being expensive, has been hindered by free riding; so far, little action has been taken. An alternative approach is to counteract climate change by reducing the amount of solar radiation that strikes the Earth\textemdash ``geoengineering.'' In contrast to emission reductions, this approach is inexpensive and can be undertaken by a single country, unilaterally. But geoengineering also has worrying consequences: it may harm some countries; it would not address ocean acidification; it would pose new risks. The fundamental challenge posed by this new technology is not free riding but governance: who should decide if and under what circumstances geoengineering should be used?},

All such systems are better described in terms of multiplex networks, where the links at each layer represent a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes rather than in terms of (single-layer) networks. In this paper we present a general framework to describe and study multiplex networks, whose links are either unweighted or weighted. In particular, we propose a series of measures to characterize the multiplexicity of the systems in terms of (i) basic node and link properties such as the node degree, and the edge overlap and reinforcement, (ii) local properties such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity, and (iii) global properties related to the navigability of the multiplex across the different layers. The measures we introduce are validated on a genuinely multiplex data set of Indonesian terrorists, where information among 78 individuals are recorded with respect to mutual trust, common operations, exchanged communications, and business relationships.},

The three German words `Zukunft Macht Technik' (the title of a TA conference in Vienna in 2015) make a nice little pun in German: they can either be interpreted as the short sentence `Future shapes technology' or as the assembly of the three nouns `future power technology.' Both readings are borne in mind in this special issue. A main insight of this special issue is that we need to explore how the debate on imagined socio-technical futures is enriched by concepts such as R(R)I, taking into account that no future can exist without an awareness of the present setting of innovation processes and technology development.},

  abstract = {During evolution, plants have developed various functional principles for sealing and healing wounds. Prime examples are succulent leaves of Delosperma cooperi that seal external injuries within 60 min. Cross sections of intact leaves show a centripetal multilayer structure consisting of five tissues alternately under tensile and compressive prestress. Injuries destroy this mechanical equilibrium causing a deformation of the entire leaf until a new equilibrium is reached, and the wound edges meet, thereby sealing the fissure. Following this functional principle of D. cooperi leaves, a planar three-layer materials system consisting of a sheet of shape memory polymer (SMP) with programmed temporary geometry sandwiched between two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets is developed. After the individual sheets are bonded at room temperature, the application of heat treatment without mechanical constraints results in a prestressed multilayer system. The damage-triggered bending behavior of the three-layer system is described by means of an analytical model and feasibility tests establishing the self-sealing functionality of the system. Thus, a biomimetic materials system with a self-sealing function within the framework of a biomimetic biology push process is developed. However, the discussion herein has gone beyond the biological model, because the self-sealing three-layer materials system can additionally serve as an actuator.},

  abstract = {Recent attempts to conduct experiments in climate `geoengineering' have demonstrated the deeply controversial nature of this field of scientific research. Social scientists have begun to explore public perceptions of geoengineering, and have documented a significant degree of concern over the effective governance of research and experimentation in this area. Yet, public perception on what constitutes a legitimate geoengineering experiment and how it should be governed remains under-researched. In this article we report on a series of experimental deliberative workshops with members of the public designed to elicit and explicate diverse understandings of geoengineering experiments and their governance. In contrast to previous methods of invited public deliberation, which privilege egalitarian-consensual models of discourse and decision-making, we test a novel approach that places majoritarian, individualistic, and consensual forms of public deliberation on an equal footing. Our study suggests that the perceived controllability of experimental interventions is central to public views on their acceptability, but that controllability is itself a complex, multifaceted quality, drawing together a set of heterogeneous concerns about the purpose and repercussions of scientific work. The citizens who participated in our workshops employed four criteria to adjudicate the acceptability of geoengineering experiments: (1) the degree of containment; (2) the uncertainty surrounding experimental outcomes; (3) the reversibility of impacts; and (4) the scientific purity of the enterprise. We theorize that the public legitimacy of geoengineering experiments depends on variable, context-specific combinations of these criteria, and that technical determinations of the proper `scale' or `location' for geoengineering research will be poor predictors of the sorts of public concerns that will be triggered by further experimentation in this area.},

Amidst a backdrop of many ways of framing the supposed normative rationales for or against their use, geoengineering proposals are undergoing serious consideration. To support decision makers in the multitude of governance considerations a growing number of appraisals are being conducted to evaluate their pros and cons. Appraisals of geoengineering are critically reviewed here for the first time using a systematic literature search and screen strategy. Substantial variability between different appraisals' outputs originates from usually hidden framing effects relating to contextual and methodological choices. Geoengineering has largely been appraised in contextual isolation, ignoring the wider portfolio of options for tackling climate change\textemdash spanning mitigation and adaptation\textemdash and creating an artificial choice between geoengineering proposals. Most existing appraisal methods do not adequately respond to the post-normal scientific context in which geoengineering resides and show a strong emphasis on closed and exclusive `expert-analytic' techniques. These and other framing effects invariably focus\textemdash or close down\textemdash upon particular sets of problem definition, values, assumptions, and courses of action. This produces a limited range of decision options which seem preferable given those framing effects that are privileged, and could ultimately contribute to the closing down of governance commitments. Emergent closure around particular geoengineering proposals is identified and argued to be premature given the need for more anticipatory, responsible, and reflexive forms of governing what is an `upstream' domain of scientific and technological development.

However, it still remains challenging to understand its determinants for the climate community. Here, we use a meta-analytic approach to examine the role of public opinion about climate change taxes and laws. Fifteen variables were examined by synthesizing 89 datasets from 51 articles across 33 countries, with a total sample of 119,465 participants. Among all factors, perceived fairness and effectiveness were the most important determinants. Self-enhancement values and knowledge about climate change showed weak relationships and demographic variables showed only weak or close to zero effects. Our meta-analytic results provide useful insights and have the potential to inform climate change researchers, practitioners and policymakers to better design climate policy instruments.},

However, when coupled with a search for certainty, this mode of understanding highlights extremes, superimposes a value hierarchy, neglects nuances of meaning, and leaves us with limited possibilities for understanding and action. This article explores bipolarizations that construct absolute differences between the knowledge-generating approaches of scientists and clinicians, clinicians and clients, and clients and scientists. It further argues that using dichotomies as contrasting truths that demarcate a range of intermediate possibilities, rather than a narrow set of either-or options, expands both what we know and what we can do.},

  abstract = {Individuals use values to frame their beliefs and simplify their understanding when confronted with complex and uncertain situations. The high complexity and deep uncertainty involved in climate risk management (CRM) lead to individuals' values likely being coupled to and contributing to their understanding of specific climate risk factors and management strategies. Most mental model approaches, however, which are commonly used to inform our understanding of people's beliefs, ignore values. In response, we developed a ``Values-informed Mental Model'' research approach, or ViMM, to elicit individuals' values alongside their beliefs and determine which values people use to understand and assess specific climate risk factors and CRM strategies. Our results show that participants consistently used one of three values to frame their understanding of risk factors and CRM strategies in New Orleans: (1) fostering a healthy economy, wealth, and job creation, (2) protecting and promoting healthy ecosystems and biodiversity, and (3) preserving New Orleans' unique culture, traditions, and historically significant neighborhoods. While the first value frame is common in analyses of CRM strategies, the latter two are often ignored, despite their mirroring commonly accepted pillars of sustainability. Other values like distributive justice and fairness were prioritized differently depending on the risk factor or strategy being discussed. These results suggest that the ViMM method could be a critical first step in CRM decision-support processes and may encourage adoption of CRM strategies more in line with stakeholders' values.},

In this article, the TSE paradigm is viewed as part of a much larger design strategy that seeks to optimize surveys by maximizing total survey quality; i.e., quality more broadly defined to include user-specified dimensions of quality. Survey methodology, viewed within this larger framework, alters our perspectives on the survey design, implementation, and evaluation. As an example, although a major objective of survey design is to maximize accuracy subject to costs and timeliness constraints, the survey budget must also accommodate additional objectives related to relevance, accessibility, interpretability, comparability, coherence, and completeness that are critical to a survey's ``fitness for use.'' The article considers how the total survey quality approach can be extended beyond survey design to include survey implementation and evaluation. In doing so, the ``fitness for use'' perspective is shown to influence decisions regarding how to reduce survey error during design implementation and what sources of error should be evaluated in order to assess the survey quality today and to prepare for the surveys of the future.},

In this situation, one would expect that developing countries\textemdash especially the least developed countries that are most vulnerable\textemdash should play a central role in the emerging discourse on climate engineering. And yet, as this article shows in detail, the discussion about whether and how to engage with these technologies is shaped by experts from just a small set of countries in the Global North. Knowledge production around climate engineering remains heavily dominated by the major research institutions in North America and Europe. Drawing on information from 70 climate engineering events between 2009 and 2017 along with extensive document analysis, the article maps a lack of involvement of developing countries and highlights the degree to which their concerns remain insufficiently represented in politically significant scientific assessment reports. The article concludes by sketching options that developing countries may have to influence the agenda on climate engineering, reflecting on earlier attempts to increase control over novel technologies and influence global agenda setting.},

Against this, the paper argues that not only applied ethics but even certain parts of general ethics have to incorporate sociological and psychological data and theories from the start. Applied ethics depends on social science in order to asses the impact of its own principles on the concrete realities which these principles are to regulate as well as in order to propose practice rules suited to adapt these principles to their respective contexts of application. Examples from medical ethics (embryo research) and ecological ethics (Leopold's land ethic) illustrate both the contingence of practice rules in relation to their underlying basic principles and the corresponding need for a co-operation between philosophy and empirical disciplines in judging their functional merits and demerits. In conclusion, the relevance of empirical hypotheses even for some of the `perennial' problems of ethics is shown by clarifying the role played by empirical theories in the controversies about the ethical differentiation between positive and negative responsibility and the relation between utility maximisation and (seemingly) independent criteria of distributive justice in the context of social distributions.},

Geoengineering technologies could have profound ramifications for our societies, and yet agreeing on an international governance framework in which even serious research into these planetary-altering technologies can take place presents an immense international political challenge. In this important book, a diverse collection of internationally respected scientists, philosophers, legal scholars, policymakers, and civil society representatives examine and reflect upon the global geoengineering debate they have helped shape. Opening with essays examining the historic origins of contemporary geoengineering ideas, the book goes on to explore varying perspectives from across the first decade of this global discourse since 2006. These essays methodically cover: the practical and ethical dilemmas geoengineering poses; the evolving geoengineering research agenda; the challenges geoengineering technologies present to current international legal and political frameworks; and differing perceptions of geoengineering from around the world. The book concludes with a series of forward looking essays, some drawing lessons from precedents for governing other global issues, others proposing how geoengineering technologies might be governed if/as they begin to emerge from the lab into the real world. This book is an indispensable resource for scientists, activists, policymakers, and political figures aiming to engage in the emerging debate about geoengineering our climate.},

Yet, in contrast to other prominent social science concepts such as democracy, the meaning and proper usage of neoliberalism curiously have elicited little scholarly debate. Based on a content analysis of 148 journal articles published from 1990 to 2004, we document three potentially problematic aspects of neoliberalism's use: the term is often undefined; it is employed unevenly across ideological divides; and it is used to characterize an excessively broad variety of phenomena. To explain these characteristics, we trace the genesis and evolution of the term neoliberalism throughout several decades of political economy debates. We show that neoliberalism has undergone a striking transformation, from a positive label coined by the German Freiberg School to denote a moderate renovation of classical liberalism, to a normatively negative term associated with radical economic reforms in Pinochet's Chile. We then present an extension of W. B. Gallie's framework for analyzing essentially contested concepts to explain why the meaning of neoliberalism is so rarely debated, in contrast to other normatively and politically charged social science terms. We conclude by proposing several ways that the term can regain substantive meaning as a ``new liberalism'' and be transformed into a more useful analytic tool.},

  abstract = {Scale development and validation are critical to much of the work in the health, social, and behavioral sciences. However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

First, it analyses how two mainstream RRI approaches, the largely substantial one by Von Schomberg and the procedural one by Stilgoe and colleagues, identify and conceptualize values. We argue that by treating values as relatively stable entities, directly available for reflection, both fall into an `entity trap'. As a result, the hermeneutic work required to identify values is overlooked. We therefore seek to bolster a practice-based take on values, which approaches values as the evolving results of valuing processes. We highlight how this approach views values as lived realities, interactive and dynamic, discuss methodological implications for RRI, and explore potential limitations. Overall, the strength of this approach is that it enables RRI scholars and practitioners to better acknowledge the complexities involved in valuing.},

Associative and propositional processes in attitude change are considered at a general level and in relation to evaluative conditioning. The role of bodily states and physical perceptions in attitude change is reviewed. This is followed by an integrative perspective on processing models of persuasion and the consideration of meta-cognitions in persuasion. Finally, effects of attitudes on information processing, social memory, and behavior are highlighted. Core themes cutting across the areas reviewed are attempts at integrative theorizing bringing together formerly disparate phenomena and viewpoints.},

However research has slowly shifted from the language-oriented towards a more cognitive-oriented point of view. This review first offers a brief summary on the methodological and formal foundations of complex networks, then it attempts a general vision of research activity on language from a complex networks perspective, and specially highlights those efforts with cognitive-inspired aim.},

This difference is argued to be purely epistemic in nature: We treat a variable as observed when the inference from data structure to variable structure can be made with certainty and as latent when this inference is prone to error. This difference in epistemic accessibility is argued to be directly related to the data-generating process, i.e., the process that produces the concrete data patterns on which statistical analyses are executed. For a variable to count as observed through a set of data patterns, the relation between variable structure and data structure should be (a) deterministic, (b) causally isolated, and (c) of equivalent cardinality. When any of these requirements is violated, (part of) the variable structure should be considered latent. It is argued that, on these criteria, observed variables are rare to nonexistent in psychology; hence, psychological variables should be considered latent until proven observed.},

The question, innocuous as it may seem, is a deep and complicated one. In contrast to the natural sciences, where researchers can safely assume that, say, all electrons are exchangeable save properties such as location and momentum, people differ from each other. Furthermore, it is not obvious that these differences can be treated as irrelevant to the structure of the organisms in question, i.e., it is not clear that they can be treated as `noise' or `error'. The problem permeates virtually every subdiscipline of psychology, and in fact may be one of the reasons that progress in psychology has been limited.

  abstract = {The portfolio of approaches to respond to the challenges posed by anthropogenic climate change has broadened beyond mitigation and adaptation with the recent discussion of potential climate engineering options. How to define and categorize climate engineering options has been a recurring issue in both public and specialist discussions. We assert here that current definitions of mitigation, adaptation, and climate engineering are ambiguous, overlap with each other and thus contribute to confusing the discourse on how to tackle anthropogenic climate change. We propose a new and more inclusive categorization into five different classes: anthropogenic emissions reductions (AER), territorial or domestic removal of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (D-GGR), trans-territorial removal of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (T-GGR), regional to planetary targeted climate modification (TCM), and climate change adaptation measures (including local targeted climate and environmental modification, abbreviated CCAM). Thus, we suggest that techniques for domestic greenhouse gas removal might better be thought of as forming a separate category alongside more traditional mitigation techniques that consist of emissions reductions. Local targeted climate modification can be seen as an adaptation measure as long as there are no detectable remote environmental effects. In both cases, the scale and intensity of action are essential attributes from the technological, climatic, and political viewpoints. While some of the boundaries in this revised classification depend on policy and judgement, it offers a foundation for debating on how to define and categorize climate engineering options and differentiate them from both mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change.

  abstract = {Background Acute effects of COVID-19 can be life-threatening. Alterations in mental health during the active infection have been documented, but the long-term consequences are less clear. Method A systematic review was undertaken to investigate the effect of COVID-19 infection on long-term mental health outcomes. Three databases [PubMed, Medline (Ovid) and Cochrane library] were searched between 1st October 2019 and 29th August 2021 with additional hand searching to identify all published studies reporting symptoms of generalised anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or sleep disturbance in participants at least one month after COVID-19 infection. The prevalence and mean symptom score of each were assessed. Results Eight hundred and eighty five studies were found, of which 33 were included in the review involving a total of 6743 participants. The studies' risk of bias were typically fair quality. The median study age of participants was 57.8 years (IQR 49.3\textendash 60.7), with 63.0\% male (IQR 57.0\%\textendash 73.0\%). Participants typically experienced no or mild symptoms of long-term anxiety (GAD-7, STAI-S, HADS) and depression (PHQ-9, BDI, PHQ-2, HADS). Prevalence varied depending on the measurement tool. Sleep disturbances (primarily insomnia) were most commonly reported as mild. PTSD prevalence was similar to anxiety and depression. Conclusion The overall effect of the pandemic has been linked with worsening psychiatric symptoms. However, the long-term effect from direct COVID-19 infection has been associated with no or mild symptoms. Studies exhibited the long-term prevalence of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and sleep disturbances to be comparable to general population levels.},

  abstract = {Starting from the intuition that people with high environmental concern have a better perception of public transport and therefore a better perception of the utility of public transport, we construct a theoretical model in which the effect of environmental concern on mode choice habits is mediated by the indirect utility of travel. Travel procures the direct utility of providing access to activities, but it also offers an indirect utility that is inherently personal and perceptual. We approach the indirect utility of public transport by measuring perceptions of time and feelings. The indirect utility of the car is approached by measuring affective and symbolic motives. Taking into account car use habits and habits of public transport use, the results show that people who have a high environmental concern perceive public transport use as easier, more useful and more pleasurable than people who do not have that environmental motivation. Such positive attitudes foster public transport use. Conversely, low environmental concern generates non-instrumental motives for car use, such as affective and symbolic motives. However, the relationship between affective and symbolic motives and car use habits is not robust. We can conclude that environmental concern influences mode choice habits and that the effect is partially mediated by perceptions and feelings towards public transport but not significantly by affective and symbolic motives for car use.},

With respect to a hypothesized model of multivariate outcomes, such trees recursively find subgroups with similar patterns of observed data. SEM trees allow for the automatic selection of variables that predict differences across individuals in specific theoretical models, for instance, differences in latent factor profiles or developmental trajectories. However, SEM trees are unstable when small variations in the data can result in different trees. As a remedy, SEM forests, which are ensembles of SEM trees based on resamplings of the original dataset, provide increased stability. Because large forests are less suitable for visual inspection and interpretation, aggregate measures provide researchers with hints on how to improve their models: (a) variable importance is based on random permutations of the out-of-bag (OOB) samples of the individual trees and quantifies, for each variable, the average reduction of uncertainty about the model-predicted distribution; and (b) case proximity enables researchers to perform clustering and outlier detection. We provide an overview of SEM forests and illustrate their utility in the context of cross-sectional factor models of intelligence and episodic memory. We discuss benefits and limitations, and provide advice on how and when to use SEM trees and forests in future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Stereotypes can influence the types of causal attributions that people make about the performance of others. Just as causal attributions may affect an individual's perception of other people, it may similarly affect perceptions of technology. Stereotypes can also influence perceived capabilities of others. In situations where stereotypes are activated, an individual's perceived capabilities are typically diminished. The tendency to adjust perceptions of capabilities of others may translate into levels of trust placed in the individual's abilities. A factorial survey using video vignettes will be utilized to assess young and older adults' attitudes toward a robot's behavior and appearance. We hypothesize that a robot's older appearance will yield lower levels of trust, more dispositional attributions, and lower perceptions of capabilities while high reliability should positively impact trust.},

However, public perception is not stable over time as emotions cool off and acceptance increases. The increase in acceptance is greater, the longer the cooling-off period between two surveys.

This study compares public perception in Germany of three specific measures: solar radiation management (SRM) via stratospheric sulphate injection, large-scale afforestation, and carbon capture and storage sub-seabed (CCS-S). In a survey experiment we find that afforestation is most readily accepted as a measure for addressing climate change, followed by CCS-S and lastly SRM, which is widely rejected. Providing additional information decreases acceptance for all measures, but their ranking remains unchanged. The acceptance of all three measures is especially influenced by the perceived seriousness of climate change and by trust in institutions. Also, respondents dislike the measures more if they perceive them as a way of shirking responsibility for emissions or as an unconscionable manipulation of nature. Women react more negatively to information than men, whereas the level of education or the degree of intuitive vs reflective decision making does not influence the reaction to information.},

It outlines the nature of the mental models approach (Morgan, Fischhoff, Bostrom and Atman, in press) to developing interventions in risk communication. It describes how social representations theory (Moscovici, 1988) can be used to account for the genesis and maintenance of a mental model of a hazard. In doing so, it is argued that mental models of hazards are social constructions, serving identifiable social purposes for the subculture in which they are elaborated, and that they are generally shared by the members of that subculture. However, within a group or subculture, there will be some individual variation in access to and use of a mental model of a hazard. It is suggested here that these variations are largely predictable on the basis of identity processes (Breakwell, in press). The implications of this analysis for risk communication strategies is explored.},

I will argue that a major problem for its development is the problem of uncertainty, which can only be overcome through methodologically sound forecasting and futures studies. I will then consider three contemporary approaches to the ethics of emerging technologies that use forecasting: ethical technology assessment, the techno-ethical scenarios approach and the ETICA approach, and I considered their strengths and weaknesses. Based on this critical study, I then present my own approach: ATE. ATE is a conceptually and methodologically rich approach for the ethical analysis of emerging technologies that incorporates a large variety of ethical principles, issues, objects and levels of analysis, and research aims.

There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-Prime\textregistered, NBS Presentation\textregistered, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task. We stress the importance of scientists making their own timing validation measurements for their own stimuli and computer configuration.},

  abstract = {Publisher: Journal of Applied Measurement, 4 (1) Page Numbers: 87-100 The act of constructing a measure requires a number of important assumptions. Principle among these assumptions is that the construct is unidimensional. In practice there are many instances when the assumption of unidimensionality does not hold, and where the application of a multidimensional measurement model is both technically appropriate and substantively advantageous. This paper illustrates the usefulness of a multidimensional approach to measurement with the Multidimensional Random Coefficient Multinomial Logit (MRCML) model, an extension of the unidimensional Rasch model. An empirical example is taken from a collection of embedded assessments administered to 541 students enrolled in middle school science classes with a hands-on science curriculum. Student achievement on these assessments are multidimensional in nature, but can also be treated as consecutive unidimensional estimates, or as is most common, as a composite unidimensional estimate. Structural parameters are estimated for each model using ConQuest, and model fit is compared. Student achievement in science is also compared across models. The multidimensional approach has the best fit to the data, and provides more reliable estimates of student achievement than under the consecutive unidimensional approach. Finally, at an interpretational level, the multidimensional approach may well provide richer information to the classroom teacher about the nature of student achievement.},

  abstract = {Climate change may well be the most important issue of the 21st century and the world's response, in the form of `Climate Engineering', is therefore of equal pre-eminent importance. However, while there are technological challenges, there are equally just as important ethical challenges that these technologies also generate. Governments, funding agencies and non-governmental organisations increasingly recognise the importance of incorporating ethics into the development of emerging technologies (for example, within the EU draft legislation on AI). As the world faces the global challenge of climate change there are urgent efforts to develop strategies so that responses to the climate problems do not reproduce more of the same. Ethical values from the onset are fundamental to this process and need highlighting. Hence, this paper analyses a series of ethical codes, framework and guidelines of the new emerging technologies of climate engineering (CE) through a review of both published academic literature and grey literature from either industry, government, and non-governmental (NGO) organisations. This paper was developed as part of a collaboration with international partners from TechEthos (TechEthos receives funding from the EU H2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 101006249; Ethics of Emerging Technologies), an EU-funded project that deals with the ethics of the new and emerging technologies anticipated to have high socio-economic impact. Our findings have identified the following ethical considerations including autonomy, freedom, integrity, human rights and privacy in the developmental process of climate engineering, while a poverty of ethical values reflecting dignity and trust were noted.},

  abstract = {Recent findings and emerging trends concerning the role of affect and emotion in climate change perceptions and judgments as well as their potential as drivers of sustainable action are reviewed. The affective responses people experience toward climate change are consistently found to be among the strongest predictors of risk perceptions, mitigation behavior, adaptation behavior, policy support, and technology acceptance. As correlational results do not imply that inducing affective states will necessarily lead to the corresponding changes in a target population, research efforts now should focus on establishing the causal pathways from affect and emotion towards climate action. Communication and intervention studies show that inducing both positive and negative emotions may under certain conditions promote sustainable behavior, but the field would benefit from a stronger integration of concepts and findings from affective psychology. Explicitly considering the mechanisms by which emotions influence decisions and actions may help design more efficient affective interventions.},

  abstract = {What is value? Where does it come from? How does it impact our emotions, motivations, decisions and experiences? Value is involved in practically every aspect of human life: whether we decide whom to marry or which political candidate to elect, whether we choose between consumer goods, whether we ask ourselves what is morally right, or beautiful, or sacred, value plays a crucial role. Today the investigation of value is central to many disciplines interested in human thinking, feeling, and behavior, such as economics, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, or sociology. Interestingly, while these disciplines all investigate value, they use different definitions and focus on different aspects of the phenomenon. The Handbook of Value combines the forces of the many disciplines involved in value research, by integrating the perspectives of distinguished scholars from the different disciplines. To allow for a high degree of interdisciplinarity, the editors assembled a panel of eminent associate editors representing the different disciplines: Professor Ernst Fehr (economics), Professor Patrik Vuilleumier (neuroscience), Professor Julien Deonna (philosophy) and Professor Fabrice Clement (sociology). Contributions cover conceptual issues such as definitions of value, psychological and neurological mechanisms underlying value computation and representation, types and taxonomies of value, interindividual and intercultural value differences, the role of value in emotion, moral judgment, decision-making and behavior, as well as "case studies" of individual varieties of value. The volume contributes to an interdisciplinary dialogue and integration by providing a common reference point that will serve as a resource for disciplinary excellence and interdisciplinary cross-fertilization. At the same time, the volume provides an excellent overview of the academic state of the art for more practically oriented readers, for example from a business background, who want to understand the determinants of value.},

Studies 2, 3, and 4 examined the structure and validity of the GCB, demonstrating internal reliability, content, criterion-related, convergent and discriminant validity, and good test-retest reliability. In sum, this research indicates that the GCB is a psychometrically sound and practically useful measure of conspiracist ideation, and the findings add to our theoretical understanding of conspiracist ideation as a monological belief system unpinned by a relatively small number of generic assumptions about the typicality of conspiratorial activity in the world.},

Third, we review debates about whether performance on implicit measures reflects traits or states. Fourth, we discuss the question of whether a person's performance on an implicit measure reflects characteristics of the person who is taking the test or characteristics of the situation in which the person is taking the test.

Individuals differ not only in the degree to which they believe in specific conspiracy theories, but also in their general susceptibility to explanations based on such theories, that is, their conspiracy mentality. We present the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), an instrument designed to efficiently assess differences in the generic tendency to engage in conspiracist ideation within and across cultures. The CMQ is available in English, German, and Turkish. In four studies, we examined the CMQ's factorial structure, reliability, measurement equivalence across cultures, and its convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity. Analyses based on a cross-cultural sample (Study 1a; N\,=\,7,766) supported the conceptualization of conspiracy mentality as a one-dimensional construct across the three language versions of the CMQ that is stable across time (Study 1b; N\,=\,141). Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated cross-cultural measurement equivalence of the CMQ items. The instrument could therefore be used to examine differences in conspiracy mentality between European, North American, and Middle Eastern cultures. In Studies 2\textendash 4 (total N\,=\,476), we report (re-)analyses of three datasets demonstrating the validity of the CMQ in student and working population samples in the UK and Germany. First, attesting to its convergent validity, the CMQ was highly correlated with another measure of generic conspiracy belief. Second, the CMQ showed patterns of meaningful associations with personality measures (e.g., Big Five dimensions, schizotypy), other generalized political attitudes (e.g., social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism), and further individual differences (e.g., paranormal belief, lack of socio-political control).

For technology, Collingridge (1980) describes a dilemma in which design inevitably comes before ethical assessment since the design influences heavily how the technology will interact with society. In this paper, we review an approach we undertook to early ethical assessment of nanobiosensors adapted for traceability systems to enhance food safety and animal and plant health monitoring. The approach is based on ``expert committee'' methods for integrating information from a range of disciplinary perspectives. It attempts to address the dilemma of early assessment through an integrative workshop discussion of how nanobiosensors should be represented during public engagement. Following the workshop, we conducted a metanalysis of the discussion transcript. The metanalysis shows that while the workshop approach responds to preliminary needs for the development of ethical assessment tools and processes, it also highlights inescapable challenges of ethical analysis. We identify key challenges and discuss their theoretical implications and implications for participatory assessment. We consider workshop discussion itself, and we consider the workshop as modeling one part of a cumulative process of assessment.},

Such comparably novel statistical techniques require specific guidelines to make them accessible to the research community. So far, researchers have provided tutorials guiding the estimation of networks and their accuracy. However, there is currently little guidance in determining what parts of the analyses and results should be documented in a scientific report. A lack of such reporting standards may foster researcher degrees of freedom and could provide fertile ground for questionable reporting practices. Here, we introduce reporting standards for network analyses in cross-sectional data, along with a tutorial and two examples. The presented guidelines are aimed at researchers as well as the broader scientific community, such as reviewers and journal editors evaluating scientific work. We conclude by discussing how the network literature specifically can benefit from such guidelines for reporting and transparency. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

A number of recurring patterns emerge: (1) general unfamiliarity with geoengineering among publics; (2) the importance of artifice versus naturalness; (3) some conditional support for certain kinds of research; and (4) nuanced findings on the ``moral hazard'' and ``reverse moral hazard'' hypotheses, with empirical support for each appearing under different circumstances and populations. We argue that in the coming decade, empirical social science research on solar geoengineering will be crucial, and should be integrated with physical scientific research.},

  abstract = {Missing data pose challenges to real-life data analysis. Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem.  This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field. This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. The book sharpens the reader's intuition on how to think about missing data, and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data.},

With each application chapter, the author "walks" the reader through all steps involved in testing the SEM model including: an explanation of the issues addressed illustrated and annotated testing of the hypothesized and post hoc models explanation and interpretation of all Mplus input and output files important caveats pertinent to the SEM application under study a description of the data and reference upon which the model was based the corresponding data and syntax files available under "Supplementary Material" below The first two chapters introduce the fundamental concepts of SEM and important basics of the Mplus program. The remaining chapters focus on SEM applications and include a variety of SEM models presented within the context of three sections: Single-group analyses, Multiple-group analyses, and other important topics, the latter of which includes the multitrait-multimethod, latent growth curve, and multilevel models. Intended for researchers, practitioners, and students who use SEM and Mplus, this book is an ideal resource for graduate level courses on SEM taught in psychology, education, business, and other social and health sciences and/or as a supplement for courses on applied statistics, multivariate statistics, intermediate or advanced statistics, and/or research design. Appropriate for those with limited exposure to SEM or Mplus, a prerequisite of basic statistics through regression analysis is recommended.},

As the evolution of a discipline is set to be reflected in the evolution of its leading journal, we attempt to characterize changes in the intellectual structure of business ethics through a bibliometric analysis of articles published in JBE.

Additionally, we use citation and co-citation analysis to provide an accurate description of the content and the advancement of research in business ethics. Through the results of our analysis, we are able to: (1) pinpoint the characteristics of the growing stock of knowledge published by JBE over the years; (2) identify the most influential works on business ethics research; and (3) detect the formation and evolution of schools of thought in business ethics.},

However, others contend that such research should be abandoned. One of the most-cited reasons as to why research into geoengineering should be abandoned is the idea that such research sits at the top of slippery slope. The Slippery Slope Argument warns that even mere research into geoengineering will create institutional momentum, ultimately leading to the deployment of a technology that is untested and perhaps morally objectionable. This article clearly lays out the Slippery Slope Argument against geoengineering research and analyses its premises. I claim that both the empirical premise \textendash{} that research will inevitably lead to deployment \textendash{} and the normative premise \textendash{} that we have decisive moral reasons to avoid deployment \textendash{} are questionable. The main conclusion of the article is that while we should be cognizant of the potential for research to lead to undesirable deployment scenarios, engaging in research need not necessarily lead inexorably to deployment. While insufficient to ground a moratorium on research, the Slippery Slope Argument points to the need for regulation and oversight in order to prevent undesirable deployment.},

The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive examination of the meaning and interpretation of the parameters in LCS models. Importantly, we focus on their relation to the shape of the trajectories and explain how different specifications of the LCS model involve particular assumptions about the mechanisms of change. On a supplementary website, we present an interactive Shiny App that allows users to explore different sets of parameter values and examine their effects on the predicted trajectories. We also include fully explained code to estimate some of the most relevant specifications of the LCS model with the R-packages lavaan and OpenMx.},

We examine whether encouraging participants to engage in more reflective thinking affects their perceptions of emerging climate technologies. Drawing on dual-process theories of reasoning, we apply experimental manipulations to encourage fast, intuitive thinking or slow, reflective thinking when responding to an online survey. Similarities in concept evaluation time between the Control and the Intuitive treatment groups indicates that citizens default to fast intuitive judgements to form opinions. However, despite a successful manipulation check, the reflective treatment group did not show any substantively different results. Therefore, encouraging additional thinking is unlikely to shift public perceptions. Post hoc analysis suggests participants with stronger views may nonetheless take more time to consider their response, without prompting. These findings support the validity of surveys as a method for eliciting stable and meaningful public perceptions of emerging technologies.},

Climate engineering approaches are increasingly proposed as near-term intervention strategies, but deployment of these controversial techniques will require careful engagement with and the support of the public. New quantitative measurements of public perceptions for six climate engineering approaches show that the public of the United Kingdom (UK), United States (US), Australia (AU) and New Zealand (NZ) continue to have little knowledge of climate engineering. All approaches are regarded unfavourably, albeit less so for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) than solar radiation management (SRM). Knowledge and perceptions are remarkably similar between countries although UK and US respondents are more favourable towards SRM and UK respondents are more favourable towards CDR. Stratospheric aerosol injection is the most negatively perceived approach. Support for small-scale trials is also higher for CDR approaches than SRM. Statistical analyses yield mixed relationships between perceptions of climate engineering and age, political affiliation and pro-ecological views. Thus far, attempts to engage the public with climate engineering have seen little change over time and consequently, there is growing urgency to facilitate careful citizen deliberation using objective and instructive information about climate engineering.},

It gives a general overview of the social consequences and ethical issues arising from technologies that can currently be reasonably expected. This overview is used to present recommendations and integrate these in a framework of responsible innovation. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} The identification of emerging ICTs and their ethical consequences is based on the review and analysis if several different bodies of literature. The individual features of the ICTs and the ethical issues identified this way are then aggregated and analysed. Findings \textendash{} The paper outlines the 11 ICTs identified. Some of the shared features that are likely to have social relevance include an increase in natural interaction, the invisibility of technology, direct links between humans and technology, detailed models and data of humans and an increasing autonomy of technology that may lead to power over the user. Ethical issues include several current topics such as privacy, data protection, intellectual property and digital divides. New problems may include changes to the way humans are perceived and the role of humans and technology in society. This includes changing power structures and different ways of treating humans. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} The paper presents a piece of foresight research which cannot claim exact knowledge of the future. However, by developing a detailed understanding of possible futures it provides an important basis for current decisions relating to future technology development and governance. Practical implications \textendash{} The paper spells out a range of recommendations for both policy makers and researchers/industry. These refer to the framework within which technology is developed and how such a framework could be designed to allow the development of ethical reflexivity. Social implications \textendash{} The work described here is likely to influence EU policy on ICT research and technology research and innovation more broadly. This may have implications for the type of technologies funded and broad implications for the social use of emerging technologies. Originality/value \textendash{} The paper presents a novel and important broad view of the future of ICTs that is required in order to inform current policy decisions.},

The MEP scale is a multilevel, self-reporting scale measuring the perceived influence that different dimensions of common ethical frameworks have on managerial decision making. The MEP scale measures on eight subscales: economic egoism, reputational egoism, act utilitarianism, rule utilitarianism, self-virtue of self, virtue of others, act deontology, and rule deontology. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to provide evidence of scale validity. Future research needs and the value of this measure for business ethics are discussed.},

We conduct a user study (n=30) to investigate the effects of fluency (absent vs. present) and effort (absent vs. present) on participants' perception of fairness. Fluency controls if the robot minimizes the idle time between the human's action and robot's action. Effort controls if the robot performs tasks that it is least skilled at, i.e., most time-consuming tasks, as quickly as possible. We evaluated four human-robot teaming algorithms that consider different levels of fluency and effort. Our results show that effort and fluency help improve fairness without making a trade-off with efficiency. When the robot displays effort, this significantly increased participants' perceived fairness. Participants' perception of fairness is also influenced by team members' skill levels and task type. To that end, we propose three notions of fairness for effective human-robot teamwork: equality of workload, equality of capability, and equality of task type.},

It is accompanied by walkthrough tutorials on data acquisition, text analysis with latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, and classification with support vector machines. Big data practitioners in academia, industry, and the community have built a comprehensive base of tools and knowledge that makes big data research accessible to researchers in a broad range of fields. However, big data research does require knowledge of software programming and a different analytical mindset. For those willing to acquire the requisite skills, innovative analyses of unexpected or previously untapped data sources can offer fresh ways to develop, test, and extend theories.

  abstract = {Trust in human-robot interactions (HRI) is measured in two main ways: through subjective questionnaires and through behavioral tasks. To optimize measurements of trust through questionnaires, the field of HRI faces two challenges: the development of standardized measures that apply to a variety of robots with different capabilities, and the exploration of social and relational dimensions of trust in robots (e.g., benevolence). In this paper we look at how different trust questionnaires (Lyons \& Guznov, 2019; Schaefer, 2016; Ullman \& Malle, 2018) fare given these challenges that pull in different directions (being general vs. being exploratory) by studying whether people think the items in these questionnaires are applicable to different kinds of robots and interactions. In Study 1 we show that after being presented with a robot (non-humanoid) and an interaction scenario (fire evacuation), participants rated multiple questionnaire items such as "This robot is principled" as "Non-applicable to robots in general" or "Non-applicable to this robot." In Study 2 we show that the frequency of these ratings change (indeed, even for items rated as N/A to robots in general) when a new scenario is presented (game playing with a humanoid robot). Finally, while overall trust scores remained robust to N/A ratings, our results revealed potential fallacies in the way these scores are commonly interpreted. We conclude with recommendations for the development, use and results-reporting of trust questionnaires for future studies, as well as theoretical implications for the field of HRI.},

Objective: In this paper we investigated how people evaluate robots that provide care and how they form impressions of the patient the robot cares for, based on how the robot represents the patient. Methods: We have used a vignette-based study, showing participants hypothetical scenarios describing behaviors of assistive robots (patient-centered or task-centered) and measured their influence on people's evaluations of the robot itself (emotional intelligence [EI], trustworthiness, and acceptability) as well as people's perceptions of the patient for whom the robot provides care. Results: We found that for scenarios describing a robot that acts in a patient-centered manner, the robot will not only be perceived as having higher EI (P=.003) but will also cause people to form more positive impressions of the patient that the robot cares for (P{$<$}.001). We replicated and expanded these results to other domains such as dieting, learning, and job training. Conclusions: These results imply that robots could be used to enhance human-human relationships in the health care context and beyond.},

The terms multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary are increasingly used in the literature, but are ambiguously defined and interchangeably used. This paper is the first of two in a series. It discusses the definitions, objectives, and evidence of effectiveness of such teamwork. Methods. The paper is a literature review based on dictionaries, and Google and MEDLINE (1982-2006) searches. Results. Multidisciplinarity draws on knowledge from different disciplines but stays within their boundaries. Interdisciplinarity analyzes, synthesizes and harmonizes links between disciplines into a coordinated and coherent whole. Transdisciplinarity integrates the natural, social and health sciences in a humanities context, and transcends their traditional boundaries. The objectives of multiple disciplinary approaches are to resolve real world or complex problems, to provide different perspectives on problems, to create comprehensive research questions, to develop consensus clinical definitions and guidelines, and to provide comprehensive health services. Multiple disciplinary teamwork has both benefits and drawbacks. Conclusion. The three terms refer to the involvement of multiple disciplines to varying degrees on the same continuum. The common words for multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary are additive, interactive and holistic respectively. With their own specific meanings, these terms should not be used interchangeably. The more general term `multiple disciplinary' is suggested for when the nature of involvement of multiple disciplines is teamwork is appropriate for complex problems, its is not always necessary in every single project.},

  abstract = {This study explored the relationships among political ideologies, masculinity ideologies, and shame ideologies within three online communities. Three different ideological communities, all on Reddit (a discussion-based social news website), were chosen based on previous research suggesting they differ in terms of their conceptualizations of gender and support for or rejection of feminism: r/TheRedPill, r/MensRights, and r/MensLib. This study uses a framework for understanding Ideologies as Complex Adaptive Systems (ICAS) as articulated by Thagard (2017), which uses Cognitive and Affective Maps (CAMs) as its primary tool of analysis. Using the postings on the Reddit sites as our raw data, we created CAMs to assist in comparing the conceptual and affective qualities of each community. We conducted the study in three phases: in Phase One, we used Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) methods and correlational analyses to create a set of general ideological CAMs for each community. We also constructed a set of CAMs depicting whom each group views as ingroups and outgroups in their creation of social identities. In Phase Two, we created a set of CAMs for each community's dominant conception of gender. In Phase Three, we constructed a set of CAMs depicting each community's relationship with the ideas of shame and injustice.  The discussion section is organized into five main chapters. The first chapter contains reflections on the process of using CAMs, the next chapter is on the study's limitations and future directions, and the final three are on the study findings' empirical, theoretical, and clinical implications. The empirical implications of the study contribute to the following areas of research: the role of shame in ideology, the political construction of victimhood, and Ambivalent Sexism. In the theoretical implications chapter, I discuss the study's potential contributions to theory development in the CAMs methodology. The final chapter offers reflections on the study's clinical implications, especially related to gender identity development, sexual violence, and the role of ideology in emotion regulation.

Weak versions of the PP may be suitable, but are not importantly different from Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). Strong versions of the PP are importantly distinct from CBA but are not a suitable basis for regulation because they lead to paradoxical outcomes if applied consistently. I consider three different lines of response to the change of paradox and argue that all three are unsatisfactory. First, I argue against Sandin's (2007) suggestion that we should be optimistic about finding a solution to the paradox on the grounds that the PP appears to be embodied in common sense reasoning. Second, I consider Weckert and Moor's (2006) attempt to resolve the PP paradox by appealing to the distinction between positive, negative and intermediate duties. I argue that this does nothing to resolve the PP paradox in many crucial cases. Furthermore, even when it can be used to resolve the paradox, it does not provide a satisfactory resolution. Third, I argue that Gardiner's (2006) attempt to recast the PP as a form of maximin is unsatisfactory because, although it resolves the PP paradox, it can only be successfully applied in a range of cases which is much narrower than the range in which advocates of strong versions of the PP typically attempt to apply the PP.},

Scholars of theology, ethics, and religious studies can act as mediators between the scientific and faith communities, providing a critical voice in understanding how religion affects the climate conversation, and in engaging a wider public.},

  abstract = {Both designers and users of social robots tend to anthropomorphize robots. Focusing on the question how to conceptualize the relation between robots and humans, this paper first outlines two opposite philosophical views regarding this relation, which are connected to various normative responses to anthropomorphism and anthropomorphization. Then it argues for a third view: navigating between what it calls ``na\"ive instrumentalism'' and ``uncritical posthumanism'', it develops a hermeneutic, relational, and critical approach. Paradoxically, by unpacking the human dimension of robotics in its use and development, this view enables a critical discussion of anthropomorphizing robots. At the same time, and again somewhat paradoxically, it avoids a na\"ive instrumentalist position by taking robots' role as an instrument in a larger con-technology seriously. As such, the third view questions the dualism assumed in the debate. The paper then explores what this means for the field of social robotics and the education of computer scientists and engineers. It proposes a reform based on a relational understanding of the field itself and offers suggestions for the role of users-citizens.},

The study represents an attempt to document the basic assumptions of Kohlberg's cognitive-developmental theory of moral judgment. Subjects were 58 boys aged 10, 13, and 16 at time 1 and were approximately equally divided at each age by social class and sociometric status. Sociometric and socioeconomic groups were equalized for intelligence. The study included six testing times-the original interview and five follow-up interviews administered at 3-4-year intervals. At each testing time subjects were individually interviewed on their judgments about nine hypothetical moral dilemmas. Interviews were stage scored according to Forms A, B, and C of the Standard Issue Scoring Manual. All scoring was done blind by individual dilemma. Data are presented on test-retest, alternate form, and interrater reliability for Standard Issue Scoring. Validity of the instrument is discussed. It was found that subjects proceeded through the developmental stages in the hypothesized sequence. No subject skipped a stage in the sequence and only 4\% (6) of the adjacent testing times showed downward stage change. This percentage was less than downward change on test-retest data. Moral judgment interviews also showed a high degree of internal consistency in stage scores assigned with the great majority of the interviews receiving all their scores at two adjacent stages. Factor analyses by dilemma and moral issue showed a single general moral stage factor. Moral judgment was found to be positively correlated with age, socio-economic status, IQ, and education. Stage scores in childhood were significantly correlated with adulthood scores. The results of this study were interpreted as being consistent with a cognitive-developmental stage model. Subjects seemed to use a coherent structural orientation in thinking about a variety of moral dilemmas. Their thinking developed in a regular sequence of stages, neither skipping a stage nor reverting to use of a prior stage. The Standard Issue Scoring System was found to be reliable, and it was concluded that it provides a valid measure of Kohlberg's moral judgment stages.},

Climate change policies generate both local and global costs and benefits, which affect the public's policy preferences. In this article we investigate the role of perceived conditional cooperation and distributive concerns on climate policy attitude formation. We identify a range of climate policies and test public opinion for adoption of these policies at different scales of government. The important theoretical distinction is the scale-driven distributional nature of policy costs and benefits as well as concerns regarding the cooperation of other actors. We use data from Sweden and a conjoint experimental design where we vary level of government, type of policy, and the targeted group. We find evidence that people support policies when costs are shared broadly. We also find that support for climate policy is conditional on expected policy adoption by other units of government at various scales. This implies that unpopular climate policies might be more popular if the funding structure of the policy allows for binding policy and that the cost-sharing is taking place at higher levels of government.},

  abstract = {A modern, comprehensive treatment of latent class and latent transition analysis for categorical data On a daily basis, researchers in the social, behavioral, and health sciences collect information and fit statistical models to the gathered empirical data with the goal of making significant advances in these fields. In many cases, it can be useful to identify latent, or unobserved, subgroups in a population, where individuals' subgroup membership is inferred from their responses on a set of observed variables. Latent Class and Latent Transition Analysis provides a comprehensive and unified introduction to this topic through one-of-a-kind, step-by-step presentations and coverage of theoretical, technical, and practical issues in categorical latent variable modeling for both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. The book begins with an introduction to latent class and latent transition analysis for categorical data. Subsequent chapters delve into more in-depth material, featuring:   A complete treatment of longitudinal latent class models   Focused coverage of the conceptual underpinnings of interpretation and evaluationof a latent class solution   Use of parameter restrictions and detection of identification problems   Advanced topics such as multi-group analysis and the modeling and interpretation of interactions between covariates   The authors present the topic in a style that is accessible yet rigorous. Each method is presented with both a theoretical background and the practical information that is useful for any data analyst. Empirical examples showcase the real-world applications of the discussed concepts and models, and each chapter concludes with a "Points to Remember" section that contains a brief summary of key ideas. All of the analyses in the book are performed using Proc LCA and Proc LTA, the authors' own software packages that can be run within the SAS\textregistered{} environment. A related Web site houses information on these freely available programs and the book's data sets, encouraging readers to reproduce the analyses and also try their own variations. Latent Class and Latent Transition Analysis is an excellent book for courses on categorical data analysis and latent variable models at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the social, behavioral, and health sciences who conduct latent class and latent transition analysis in their everyday work.},

  abstract = {Science studies has shown us why science and technology cannot always solve technical problems in the public domain. In particular, the speed of political decision-making is faster than the speed of scientific consensus formation. A predominant motif over recent years has been the need to extend the domain of technical decision-making beyond the technically qualified \'elite, so as to enhance political legitimacy. We argue, however, that the `Problem of Legitimacy' has been replaced by the `Problem of Extension' - that is, by a tendency to dissolve the boundary between experts and the public so that there are no longer any grounds for limiting the indefinite extension of technical decision-making rights. We argue that a Third Wave of Science Studies - Studies of Expertise and Experience (SEE) - is needed to solve the Problem of Extension. SEE will include a normative theory of expertise, and will disentangle expertise from political rights in technical decision-making. The theory builds categories of expertise, starting with the key distinction between interactive expertise and contributory expertise. A new categorization of types of science is also needed. We illustrate the potential of the approach by re-examining existing case studies, including Brian Wynne's study of Cumbrian sheep farmers. Sometimes the new theory argues for more public involvement, sometimes for less. An Appendix describes existing contributions to the problem of technical decision-making in the public domain.},

We present results of a meta-analysis that examines the role of trust in institutions, scientists, industry, environmental groups and people in general, in relation to different climate-friendly behaviours. We further categorise behaviours into `public' and `private' behaviours and conduct meta-regressions to see whether these categories moderate overall effect sizes. Analysing 141 correlations from 51 studies (46 articles), we find that trust in scientists and trust in environmental groups strongly correlate with climate-friendly behaviours. Meta-regressions further show that trust in institutions is moderately correlated with public behaviours, but only weakly with private behaviours, while associations with trust in industry and general trust measures are weak. We discuss the implications of these findings for climate scientists and how experts can potentially increase trust levels to foster engagement in climate-friendly behaviours.},

  abstract = {A rising trend can be observed in robot development towards the usage of flexible materials, whose properties resemble their biological counterparts. This way of design promises machines that are more adaptive, energy efficient and cost effective. One of the biggest challenges in this growing research field is the fabrication of functional elements, which consist of several embedded materials. The lack of compatible substances and of a proper prototyping technology limits the possible complexity and the degree of automation in prototyping. Furthermore, additive manufacturing techniques are usually designed for predefined purposes and do not have the customizability the research in an innovative field requires. In order to address this problem a novel multi-material 3D-printer with on-demand tool change has been developed. The adaptive locking mechanism in combination with a kinematic coupling allows the device to switch between tools varying in the dispensed material and even work principle. Using specifically developed directly driven filament-print-heads, a series of test specimen has been fabricated. The very reliable and precise extrusion, even of highly flexible material, is demonstrated in form of airtight chambers utilized as pneumatic actuators. In an additional demonstrator the flexible part has been reduced to a single expandable membrane as the active element included in an otherwise stiff housing. A specific design made it possible to embed the membrane in the surrounding, which compensated for the lack of chemical bonding between both substances and created a pneumatic actuator with a much better stability/performance ratio. These demonstrators highlight the great potential to create yet unbuilt biomimetic structures and multi-material systems with this novel multi-material printer.},

Fabricating such systems usually requires manual assembly or molding steps, which extend the time between designing and testing of a new concept. In order to streamline rapid prototyping this study used a multi-material FDM 3D printer for producing a simplified robotic arm with an integrated pneumatic muscle. The actuator working as a pneumatic bicep is printed from thermoplastic polyurethane with a shore hardness of A70, while the arm itself is made of rigid polylactic acid. During the printing process the muscle is, while being printed itself, embedded into the arm by a physical joint, through which the arm assembly can change its angle according to the actuation. In this work, we describe the challenges appearing in such a combined processing of two different materials and how they are addressed. Through its design the resulting soft robotic arm is printed without the need of any support material inside its hollow structures and is ready for testing right after the printing finished. By applying negative pressure to the actuator's inlet, the arm was able to lift up to 270~g load.},

Nevertheless, the rapid prototyping of such actuators is still challenging since conventional 3D printers are not designed to fabricate airtight objects or to specify their bending behavior by combining materials of different stiffness. In order to address this challenge, a tool changing multi-material 3D printer has been constructed, which can be equipped with various print-heads fitted to the specific application. By alternately processing filaments with varying mechanical properties, a series of pneumatic elements was produced. The actuators were printed in thermoplastic polyurethane with shore hardness A70 for flexible parts and D65 for stiff parts. A novel procedure for the feature adaptation of the flow rate allowed the fabrication of vertically printed flexible membranes with a thickness of just 500 {$\mu$}m. This way the bending and expanding printed structures can all be actuated with a pressure of 100 kPa or less. Furthermore, a new kind of generic actuator that is customizable to specific tasks and can perform complex motion behavior was designed. All together, these actuators demonstrate the high potential of the developed platform for further research on and production of soft robotic elements and complex pressurized systems.},

  abstract = {As efforts to control climate change gain momentum, so too does the possibility that some global actor(s) will deploy one or more forms of climate engineering. Climate engineering refers to large-scale and deliberate activities intended to change either the carbon-balance or energy-balance of the planet. Climate engineering approaches are untested, involve deep uncertainty, and have far-reaching consequences. Nevertheless, many scientists expect that, relative to conventional mitigation approaches, some climate-engineering approaches will prove less expensive and will require less coordination. They will also have more potential for unilateral deployment. Decisions to pursue climate engineering involve several psychosocial dimensions related to attitude and preference formation, decision making under uncertainty, interpersonal coordination, and health and well-being. Even the prospect of climate engineering could affect norms, goals, and beliefs. The field of psychological science should prepare to help society responsibly consider climate engineering alongside more conventional climate-change responses.

  abstract = {Researchers have used ``sacrificial'' trolley-type dilemmas (where harmful actions promote the greater good) to model competing influences on moral judgment: affective reactions to causing harm that motivate characteristically deontological judgments (``the ends don't justify the means'') and deliberate cost-benefit reasoning that motivates characteristically utilitarian judgments (``better to save more lives''). Recently, Kahane, Everett, Earp, Farias, and Savulescu (2015) argued that sacrificial judgments reflect antisociality rather than ``genuine utilitarianism,'' but this work employs a different definition of ``utilitarian judgment.'' We introduce a five-level taxonomy of ``utilitarian judgment'' and clarify our longstanding usage, according to which judgments are ``utilitarian'' simply because they favor the greater good, regardless of judges' motivations or philosophical commitments. Moreover, we present seven studies revisiting Kahane and colleagues' empirical claims. Studies 1a\textendash 1b demonstrate that dilemma judgments indeed relate to utilitarian philosophy, as philosophers identifying as utilitarian/consequentialist were especially likely to endorse utilitarian sacrifices. Studies 2\textendash 6 replicate, clarify, and extend Kahane and colleagues' findings using process dissociation to independently assess deontological and utilitarian response tendencies in lay people. Using conventional analyses that treat deontological and utilitarian responses as diametric opposites, we replicate many of Kahane and colleagues' key findings. However, process dissociation reveals that antisociality predicts reduced deontological inclinations, not increased utilitarian inclinations. Critically, we provide evidence that lay people's sacrificial utilitarian judgments also reflect moral concerns about minimizing harm. This work clarifies the conceptual and empirical links between moral philosophy and moral psychology and indicates that sacrificial utilitarian judgments reflect genuine moral concern, in both philosophers and ordinary people.},

  abstract = {Due to a variety of reasons, the previous century is characterized by an extraordinary growth in car use that has continued into the current century. This has resulted in serious environmental repercussions. Despite technological advancements, the externalities remain an ecological threat that can not be discarded by policy makers. Therefore, it is essential that policy makers focus on reducing car use and on stimulating the shift towards more environment-friendly transport modes. In this study, Q-methodology is adopted as the technique to segment people, and to ascertain which approaches and determinants matter to medium distance travel. Segmentation is important, as policy measures will be more efficient and effective if they are fine-tuned on specific target groups. The analysis revealed that four discourses preponderate the paradigm of environmentally sustainable transport: travelers who use public transport as a dominant alternative, car-dependent travelers, travelers with a positive perception of using public transport, and travelers with a preference for car use. Concerning rational, economic motives, individuals evaluate travel time reliability as most important. To increase the reliability policy makers should consider the use of separate bus lanes and traffic light manipulation. In addition, public transport can be made even more attractive, when costs of cars are made more variable by road or congestion charging. When the s motives are discussed, the differences between the different groups of travelers were more pronounced. Next to increasing the benefits of using public transport, policy makers should also pay attention to removing psycho-social barriers.},

As geoengineering continues to attract scholarly and policy interest, a number of frames have emerged in the scientific, political and media discourse. In the current paper, we provide an empirical test of one of the most prevalent framing devices: describing geoengineering technologies by analogy to natural processes. In an online experiment with members of the UK public, participants who read a description of geoengineering technologies as analogous to natural processes were more likely to support geoengineering as a response to climate change. In addition, participants' views about the relationship between geoengineering and nature strongly predicted support for geoengineering. Our findings suggest that communicators should be cautious when using natural analogies to communicate about geoengineering with the general public, as frame choice is likely to influence public attitudes and potentially convey undue positivity.},

This argument plays a central role in policy debates about geoengineering. However, there has not yet been a systematic investigation of how members of the public view the moral hazard argument, or whether it impacts on people's beliefs about geoengineering and climate change. In this paper, we describe an online experiment with a representative sample of the UK public, in which participants read one of two arguments (either endorsing or rejecting the idea that geoengineering poses a moral hazard). The argument endorsing the idea of geoengineering as a moral hazard was perceived as more convincing overall. However, people with more sceptical views and those who endorsed `self-enhancing' values were more likely to agree that the prospect of geoengineering would reduce their motivation to make changes in their own behaviour in response to climate change. The findings suggest that geoengineering is likely to pose a moral hazard for some people more than others, and the implications for engaging the public are discussed.},

Siting geothermal energy projects can be challenging because of induced seismicity related to deep geothermal energy, which may reduce public acceptance. This research investigates how informing the public about seismic risk associated with deep geothermal projects influences affect, emotions, attitudes, and the perceived risks and benefits related to both, deep and shallow geothermal projects. Two between-subjects experimental studies were conducted with representative samples of the Swiss population (N1~=~1{${'}$}018; N2~=~1{${'}$}007). Results show that information about seismic risk of deep geothermal energy projects significantly influences perceptions of associated projects. Specifically, a spillover effect of seismic risk information on shallow geothermal projects is observed for affect and emotions, as well as for perceived risks and benefits, but not for attitudes. Spillover effects were stronger when information about seismic risk was presented in a negative, emotionally laden manner. For policymakers, the results suggest that the population is open to the use of geothermal energy, but early communication will be key to avoiding a decline in acceptance. This research also highlights the importance of measuring affective factors, in addition to cognitive ones, in acceptance research.},

Results: The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon \& Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory. Conclusion: The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.},

Based on data from an international sample of 1563 digital natives, a model is proposed and tested (1) that introduces ethical judgment and its five dimensions (``moral equity'', ``relativism'', ``utilitarianism'', ``egoism'' and ``contractualism'') to explain intention to use intelligent capacity-enhancing technological devices; (2) that helps to explain the technological leap involved in moving from wearing technologies to incorporating them into the human body, through the moderating role that technology type has in the relationship between ethical judgment and intention to use. The results showed that: (1) Ethical judgment is key for the acceptance of wearables and insideables, and has greater explanatory capacity for insideables than for wearables; (2) ``Egoism'' has the highest explanatory power for intention to use insideables and ``utilitarianism'' is the most important dimension for intention to use wearables. Finally, a series of operational implications are proposed to guide the development and commercialisation of devices, while taking into account the ethical judgment of the users.},

  abstract = {Control of walking in rugged terrain requires one to incorporate different issues, such as the mechanical properties of legs and muscles, the neuronal control structures for the single leg, the mechanics and neuronal control structures for the coordination between legs, as well as central decisions that are based on external information and on internal states. Walking in predictable environments and fast running, to a large degree, rely on muscle mechanics. Conversely, slow walking in unpredictable terrain, e.g. climbing in rugged structures, has to rely on neuronal systems that monitor and intelligently react to specific properties of the environment. An arthropod model system that shows the latter abilities is the stick insect, based on which this review will be focused. An insect, when moving its six legs, has to control 18 joints, three per leg, and therefore has to control 18 degrees of freedom (d.f.). As the body position in space is determined by 6 d.f. only, there are 12 d.f. open to be selected. Therefore, a fundamental problem is as to how these extra d.f. are controlled. Based mainly on behavioural experiments and simulation studies, but also including neurophysiological results, the following control structures have been revealed. Legs act as basically independent systems. The quasi-rhythmic movement of the individual leg can be described to result from a structure that exploits mechanical coupling of the legs via the ground and the body. Furthermore, neuronally mediated influences act locally between neighbouring legs, leading to the emergence of insect-type gaits. The underlying controller can be described as a free gait controller. Cooperation of the legs being in stance mode is assumed to be based on mechanical coupling plus local positive feedback controllers. These controllers, acting on individual leg joints, transform a passive displacement of a joint into an active movement, generating synergistic assistance reflexes in all mechanically coupled joints. This architecture is summarized in the form of the artificial neural network, Walknet, that is heavily dependent on sensory feedback at the proprioceptive level. Exteroceptive feedback is exploited for global decisions, such as the walking direction and velocity.},

These descriptions concern the trajectories of the end of the tibia and the changes of the femur-tibia joint ({$\gamma$}), the coxa-trochanter joint ({$\beta$}) and the movement of the thoracic-coxal joint of all three pairs of legs. As the latter joint comprises a ball and socket joint, the changes of the position of the rotational axis of this joint have been measured. No simple rule could be found which allowed the control of more than one joint of a leg by a common control parameter. Co-ordination of the joints of one leg seems to be simpler during the swing than during the stance movement. Measurements of the forces at the end of the swing movement indicate that there is no information transfer between legs with respect to an expected height of the ground at the end of the swing movement, nor is there an internal ``expectation'' which may have led to a decrease of force before probable ground contact.},

As evidence of the anthropogenic influence on the Earth's climate has grown over the past few decades, climate change has come to be viewed as a primary challenge to be confronted in the twenty-first century. Geoengineering, or climate engineering, is a set of large-scale technological interventions proposed to offset climatic changes. This study seeks to understand which factors contribute to, or alternatively, detract from public acceptance of geoengineering through robust path analytic modeling of public perceptions of geoengineering that may better serve the academic community and decision-makers. This study finds that familiarity, epistemic trust, preference for alternative solutions to climate change, and media consumption are interrelated in their influences on opinions toward geoengineering proposals and support for funding further geoengineering research. Such predictive modeling can enable risk communicators and policy-makers with vital information to support anticipatory governance approaches to policy initiatives and improve future public engagement and communication about geoengineering.},

While this set of technologies may provide significant benefit to future society, it may also be controversial for a variety of reasons including values-based objections and uncertainties regarding the manageability and potential irreversibility of the technologies. Studies of public perceptions of geoengineering have begun to elicit responses to these proposed technologies, yet the findings of such work are scattered across many publications, and represent the work of a variety of scholars using many methods to collect data. This work provides a systematic review of empirical literature regarding the methods and results of public perception studies of 2 distinct geoengineering approaches: carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management. Reviewing public opinion data regarding these sets of technologies can provide a stronger basis of understanding that can empower anticipatory governance initiatives, future decision-making, and risk communication. We do not analyze public opinion studies regarding carbon dioxide capture and storage, as other reviews have been recently published elsewhere. Four key themes are identified and reviewed across studies: (1) support for research and use of geoengineering, (2) risk and benefit perceptions, (3) familiarity with geoengineering, and (4) trust in governing bodies. This review also discusses methodological issues pertaining to participant sampling and framing of geoengineering technologies within the reviewed studies.},

Recently, the causal attitude network (CAN) model was proposed as a comprehensive measurement model of attitudes, which conceptualizes attitudes as networks of causally connected evaluative reactions (i.e., beliefs, feelings, and behavior toward an attitude object). Here, we test the central postulate of the CAN model that highly connected attitude networks correspond to strong attitudes. We use data from the American National Election Studies 1980?2012 on attitudes toward presidential candidates (N = 18,795). We first show that political interest predicts connectivity of attitude networks toward presidential candidates. Second, we show that connectivity is strongly related to two defining features of strong attitudes?stability of the attitude and the attitude?s impact on behavior. We conclude that network theory provides a promising framework to advance the understanding of attitude strength.},

Far from interfering with rationality, his research shows us, the absence of emotion and feeling can break down rationality and make wise decision making almost impossible.},

The Rasch model is designed for categorical data, often collected as ex- inees' responses to multiple tasks such as cognitive items from psychological tests or from educational assessments. The Rasch model's elegant mathema- cal form is suitable for extensions that allow for greater ?exibility in handling complex samples of examinees and collections of tasks from di?erent domains.

These we term: `the rich get richer and the poor get poorer'; `kept in the dark'; `opening Pandora's box'; `messing with nature'; and `be careful what you wish for'. We further suggest that these narratives can be understood as sharing an emphasis on the `giftedness' of life, and that together they are used to resist dominant technoscientific and Enlightenment narratives of control and mastery which are encapsulated by nanotechnology.},

Yet, we argue that the sample and effect sizes in published psychological research are frequently so small that sample means are insufficiently accurate to determine whether treatment effects have occurred. Generally, an estimator should be more accurate than any benchmark that systematically ignores information about the relations among experimental conditions. We consider two such benchmark estimators: one that randomizes the relations among conditions and another that always assumes no treatment effects. We show conditions under which these benchmark estimators estimate the true parameters more accurately than sample means. This perverse situation can occur even when effects are statistically significant at traditional levels. Our argument motivates the need for regularized estimates, such as those used in lasso, ridge, and hierarchical Bayes techniques.},

Multi-level modelling revealed that these perceptions varied across socio-demographic factors (e.g. gender), political orientation, marine contact factors (e.g. marine occupation and engagement in coastal recreation activities) and personality traits (e.g. openness, conscientiousness and agreeableness). Quantifying attitudes, as well as understanding how individual-level differences shape risk perception will enable policy makers and communicators to develop more targeted communications and initiatives that target a reduction in marine plastic pollution.},

  abstract = {Errors in requirements specifications have been identified as a major contributor to costly software project failures. It would be highly beneficial if information systems developers could verify requirements by predicting workplace acceptance of a new system based on user evaluations of its specifications measured during the earliest stages of the development project, ideally before building a working prototype. However, conventional wisdom among system developers asserts that prospective users must have direct hands-on experience with at least a working prototype of a new system before they can provide assessments that accurately reflect future usage behavior after workplace implementation. The present research demonstrates that this assumption is only partially true. Specifically, it is true that stable and predictive assessments of a system's perceived ease of use should be based on direct behavioral experience using the system. However, stable and behaviorally predictive measures of perceived usefulness can be captured from target users who have received information about a system's functionality, but have not had direct hands-on usage experience. This distinction is key because, compared to ease of use, usefulness is generally much more strongly linked to future usage intentions and behaviors in the workplace. Two longitudinal field experiments show that preprototype usefulness measures can closely approximate hands-on based usefulness measures, and are significantly predictive of usage intentions and behavior up to six months after workplace implementation. The present findings open the door toward research on how user acceptance testing may be done much earlier in the system development process than has traditionally been the case. Such preprototype user acceptance tests have greater informational value than their postprototype counterparts because they are captured when only a relatively small proportion of project costs have been incurred and there is greater flexibility to modify a new system's design attributes. Implications are discussed for future research to confirm the robustness of the present findings and to better understand the practical potential and limitations of preprototype user acceptance testing.},

  abstract = {Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

A traditional questionnaire was used simultaneously (n=327) to study uninformed evaluations of these technologies. The results showed that the Dutch public is mostly unaware of CCS and has little knowledge about how current energy use causes global warming. Uninformed respondents are still inclined to give their opinion however, which results in unpredictive, easily changeable opinions. ICQ respondents who processed information on attributes of CCS options were likely to base their option evaluations on this information, though not entirely. All in all, the results of the ICQ suggest that, after processing information deemed necessary by experts, Dutch people reluctantly agree with large scale implementation of each of the six CCS options.},

Adaptive Mediation is thus a specific approach designed to cope with complexity and sees the role of the mediator as limited to facilitating a process of emergent self-organization. This chapter unpacks these aspects in more detail and explores the theoretical foundation of Adaptive Mediation to understand how it is grounded in what we know about the behavior of complex social systems.},

Most of these peace agreements share at their core a similar logic and structure, deriving from a determined-designed model and the so-called international best practices, which tend to be linear, staged, normative, and individualistic in orientation.

We describe the collection of word associations for over 12,000 cue words, currently the largest such English-language resource in the world. Our procedure allowed subjects to provide multiple responses for each cue, which permits us to measure weak associations. We evaluate the utility of the dataset in several different contexts, including lexical decision and semantic categorization. We also show that measures based on a mechanism of spreading activation derived from this new resource are highly predictive of direct judgments of similarity. Finally, a comparison with existing English word association sets further highlights systematic improvements provided through these new norms.},

First, we investigated the correspondence of word class in association cues and responses. Nouns were the modal word class response, regardless of the word class of the cue, indicating a dominant paradigmatic response style. Next, the word association data were used to build an associative network to investigate the centrality of nodes. The study of node centrality showed that central nodes in the network tended to be highly frequent and acquired early. Small-world properties of the association network were investigated and compared with a large English association network (Steyvers \& Tenenbaum, 2005). Networks based on a multiple association procedure showed small-world properties despite being denser than networks based on a discrete task. Finally, a semantic taxonomy was used to investigate the composition of semantic types in association responses. The majority of responses were thematically related situation responses and entity responses referring to parts, shape, or color. Since the association task required multiple responses per cue, the interaction between generation position and semantic role could be investigated and discussed in the framework of recent theories of natural concept representations (Barsalou, Santos, Simmons, \& Wilson, in press).},

  abstract = {Climate change skepticism (CCS) is a significant impediment to sustainable behavior. An in-depth understanding of CCS is therefore essential. However, existing measures vary considerably. In this paper, we address the differences and limitations of existing measures of CCS and present a new measure. In three studies (n~=~534; n~=~352; n~=~252), we examined the factor structure, test-retest reliability, and associations with intentions for sustainable behaviors, psychological resistance to change, and dispositional tendencies for motivated reasoning. The resulting climate change skepticism questionnaire (CCS-Q) is a 12-item scale that assesses four dimensions of CCS: trend, attribution, impact, and response skepticism. The CCS-Q combines expressions of doubt or uncertainty with denial. The studies we conducted support our four-dimensional structure and test-retest reliability was good. Furthermore, CCS-Q scores were negatively related to intentions for sustainable behavior and positively related to resistance to change. We did not find any association with motivated reasoning. Overall, the new CCS-Q offers a reliable and valid measure for CCS.},

Mobilizing Chantal Mouffe's theory of pluralistic agonism, we argue that TA communities should break with the myth of neutrality to render their political identities explicit and to recognize that TA does not only have politics, it also is politics. To do so, the notion of `constitutive outside' is mobilized as a guiding methodological principle to invent a politics of TA. Three sites of politics where to define such a `constitutive outside' are suggested: the values, the visions of the future, and the hegemonic and counter-hegemonic practices. We conclude that with a full awareness of its politics, TA communities should be able, on the one hand, to gain the trust and active support of political actors committed to the same ideals of democracy and knowledge-based policy-making. On the other hand, TA communities will also be able to distinguish TA supporters and adversaries and, consequently, reinforce their power of influence on policy-making. In a time of political uncertainty and epistemic ambiguity, TA communities may become a bastion of democratic politics.},

Main outcome measures: inclusion and centrality of factors in mental models of COVID-19 infection spread.Results Mitigation measures issued by government, adherence to measures, and virus characteristics were most strongly represented in participants' mental models. Participants who perceived measures as appropriate or who experienced more control and more worry over the spread of the virus created more complex models compared to participants who were less satisfied with measures or who felt lower control and less worry.Conclusion These findings suggest that people are able to create sensible mental models of virus transmission but may appreciate transparent communication to comprehend the bigger picture behind the governmental mitigation strategy.},

In the immediate future, metrics related to safety and dependability have to be found in order to successfully introduce robots in everyday enviornments. While there are certainly also ``cognitive'' issues involved, due to the human perception of the robot (and vice versa), and other objective metrics related to fault detection and isolation, our discussion focuses on the peculiar aspects of ``physical'' interaction with robots. In particular, safety and dependability are the underlying evaluation criteria for mechanical design, actuation, and control architectures. Mechanical and control issues are discussed with emphasis on techniques that provide safety in an intrinsic way or by means of control components. Attention is devoted to dependability, mainly related to sensors, control architectures, and fault handling and tolerance. Suggestions are provided to draft metrics for evaluating safety and dependability in pHRI, and references to the works of the scientific groups involved in the pHRI research complete the study. The present atlas is a result of the EURON perspective research project ``Physical Human\textendash Robot Interaction in anthropic DOMains (PHRIDOM)'', aimed at charting the new territory of pHRI, and constitutes the scientific basis for the ongoing STReP project ``Physical Human\textendash Robot Interaction: depENDability and Safety (PHRIENDS)'', aimed at developing key components for the next generation of robots, designed to share their environment with people.},

In this work, we try to shed some light on various issues focusing on a typical dataset. It is shown that the learning rate prevents the exact mapping of the co-occurrence matrix, that Word2Vec is unable to learn syntactic relationships, and that it does not suffer from the problem of overfitting. Furthermore, through the creation of an ad-hoc network, it is also shown how it is possible to improve Word2Vec directly on the analogies, obtaining very high accuracy without damaging the pre-existing embedding. This analogy-enhanced Word2Vec may be convenient in various NLP scenarios, but it is used here as an optimal starting point to evaluate the limits of Word2Vec.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) often raises fears when deployed in new occupations, in a way that varies substantially across countries. Here we show that these country-level variations across occupations can be predicted by a psychological model at the individual level. Individuals fear AI in a given occupation as a function of the mismatch between psychological traits they deem necessary for an occupation, and perceived potential of AI to possess these traits. Country-level variations can then be predicted by the joint cultural variations in psychological requirements and AI potential. We validated this pre-registered prediction for six occupations (doctors, judges, managers, care workers, religious workers, and journalists), on a representative sample of 500 participants from each of 20 countries (total N = 10,000). Our findings may help develop best practices for designing and communicating about AI in a principled yet culturally sensitive way, avoiding one-size-fits-all approaches centered on Western values and perceptions.},

What are the psychological consequences of adopting these theories? We review the current research and find that it answers the first of these questions more thoroughly than the second. Belief in conspiracy theories appears to be driven by motives that can be characterized as epistemic (understanding one's environment), existential (being safe and in control of one's environment), and social (maintaining a positive image of the self and the social group). However, little research has investigated the consequences of conspiracy belief, and to date, this research does not indicate that conspiracy belief fulfills people's motivations. Instead, for many people, conspiracy belief may be more appealing than satisfying. Further research is needed to determine for whom, and under what conditions, conspiracy theories may satisfy key psychological motives.},

  abstract = {For more than 20 years there has been a concerted international effort toward addressing climate change. International conventions, such as the United Nations Foreign Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC; ratified in 1994), have been established by committed nations seeking to address global climate change through the reduction of greenhouse gases emitted into the Earth's atmosphere (Global CCS Institute, 2011). Long recognised as the most crucial of the greenhouse gases to impact global warming, the majority of carbon dioxide's anthropogenic global emissions are directly related to fuel combustion of which both Australia and the Netherlands' energy production is significantly reliant. Both these nations will need to consider many opinions and make hard decisions if alternative energy options are to be implemented at the scale that is required to meet international emission targets. The decisions that are required not only need to consider the many options available but also their consequences. Along with politicians, policy developers and industry, the general public also need to be active participants in deciding which energy options, and their subsequent consequences, are acceptable for implementation at the national level. Access to balanced and factual information is essential in establishing informed opinions on the many policy options available. Past research has used several methods to measure public perceptions and opinions yet for complex issues, such as emission reduction, some of these methods have shown to be problematic. For example, semi structured interviews can provide data that is flexible and context rich yet is does also come with the limitations such as it seldom provides a practical assessment that can be utilised from researcher to researcher, across disciplines and public participation techniques. Surveys on the other hand usually address these limitations but surveys that do not encourage comparison of information or ask participants to evaluate and choose between several options tend to lead to pseudo-opinions, incorrect assumptions and isolated responses. In order to address these methodological issues, researchers in the Netherlands created an Information Choice Questionnaire (ICQ). The ICQ provides the respondent with: (1) the entire (complex) policy problem, (2) expert information that is independent and balanced, (3) in a way that is understandable for the general public, (4) is a comparative process, and (5) asks for an evaluation. The aim of this research was to develop an online decision guide to aid public awareness, knowledge, deliberation and choice around carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) compared with other greenhouse gas mitigation options. More specifically, the objectives were to: (a) compare the Australian survey results to Dutch respondents; and (b) examine the most effective way to make online information and opinion formation more interactive and engaging. The following research questions are addressed: (1) How do Australian opinions on energy options differ from the Dutch when measured using the ICQ? ; (2) Is it possible to enhance the quality of the original ICQ by making the questionnaire an interactive application?.},

Developing a shared understanding of the science related to risk is crucial for diverse individuals to collaboratively manage disaster consequences. Mental models, or people's psychological representation of how the `world works', present a valuable tool to achieve this. Potential applications range from developing effective risk communication for use in short-warning situations to community co-development of future communication protocols for the co-management of risk. A diverse range of tools, in diverse fields, have thus been developed to elicit these mental models. Forty-four articles were selected via inclusion criteria from 561 found through a systematic search. We identified a wide range of direct and indirect elicitation techniques (concept, cognitive, flow, information world, knowledge, mind, and fuzzy cognitive maps, and decision influence diagrams) and interview-based techniques. Many used multiple elicitation techniques such as free-drawing, interviews, free-listing, sorting tasks, attitudinal surveys, photograph elicitation, metaphor analysis, and mapping software. We identify several challenges when designing elicitation methods, including researcher influence, the importance of external visualization, a lack of evaluation, the role of `experts', and ethical considerations due to the influence of the process itself. We present a preliminary typology for elicitation and analysis and suggest future research should explore methods to assess the evolution of mental models to understand how conceptualisations change through time, experience, or public education programs. These lessons have the potential to benefit both science and disaster risk communication activities, given best practice calls for mutually constructed understanding.},

  abstract = {Although ``mental models'' are of central importance to system dynamics research and practice, the field has yet to develop an unambiguous and agreed upon definition of them. To begin to address this problem, existing definitions and descriptions of mental models in system dynamics and several literatures related to cognitive science were reviewed and compared. Available definitions were found to be overly brief, general, and vague, and different authors were found to markedly disagree on the basic characteristics of mental models. Based on this review, we concluded that in order to reduce the amount of confusion in the literature, the mental models concept should be ``unbundled'' and the term ``mental models'' should be used more narrowly. To initiate a dialogue through which the system dynamics community might achieve a shared understanding of mental models, we propose a new definition of ``mental models of dynamic systems'' accompanied by an extended annotation that explains the definitional choices made and suggests terms for other cognitive structures left undefined by narrowing the mental model concept. Suggestions for future research that could improve the field's ability to further define mental models are discussed. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

For this purpose, we provide a cross-disciplinary overview of empirical and experimental research on public attitudes and preferences that has emerged in the last few years. The various factors influencing policy support are divided into three general categories: (1) social-psychological factors and climate change perception, such as the positive influences of left-wing political orientation, egalitarian worldviews, environmental and self-transcendent values, climate change knowledge, risk perception, or emotions like interest and hope; (2) the perception of climate policy and its design, which includes, among others, the preference of pull over push measures, the positive role of perceived policy effectiveness, the level of policy costs, as well as the positive effect of perceived policy fairness and the recycling of potential policy revenues; (3) contextual factors, such as the positive influence of social trust, norms and participation, wider economic, political and geographical aspects, or the different effects of specific media events and communications. Finally, we discuss the findings and provide suggestions for future research.Policy relevancePublic opinion is a significant determinant of policy change in democratic countries. Policy makers may be reluctant to implement climate policies if they expect public opposition. This article seeks to provide a better understanding of the various factors influencing public responses to climate policy proposals. Most of the studied factors include perceptions about climate change, policy and its attributes, all of which are amenable to intervention. The acquired insights can thus assist in improving policy design and communication with the overarching objective to garner more public support for effective climate policy.},

  abstract = {Pneumatically actuated soft robots have recently shown promise for their ability to adapt to their environment. Previously, these robots have been controlled with electromechanical components, such as valves and pumps, that are typically bulky and expensive. Here, we present an approach for controlling the gaits of soft-legged robots using simple pneumatic circuits without any electronic components. This approach produces locomotive gaits using ring oscillators composed of soft valves that generate oscillating signals analogous to biological central pattern generator neural circuits, which are acted upon by pneumatic logic components in response to sensor inputs. Our robot requires only a constant source of pressurized air to power both control and actuation systems. We demonstrate this approach by designing pneumatic control circuits to generate walking gaits for a soft-legged quadruped with three degrees of freedom per leg and to switch between gaits to control the direction of locomotion. In experiments, we controlled a basic walking gait using only three pneumatic memory elements (valves). With two oscillator circuits (seven valves), we were able to improve locomotion speed by 270\%. Furthermore, with a pneumatic memory element we designed to mimic a double-pole double-throw switch, we demonstrated a control circuit that allowed the robot to select between gaits for omnidirectional locomotion and to respond to sensor input. This work represents a step toward fully autonomous, electronics-free walking robots for applications including low-cost robotics for entertainment and systems for operation in environments where electronics may not be suitable.},

The most popular topic for deliberation has been genetically modified (GM) foods. Despite the varied circumstances of their establishment, deliberative ``minipublics'' almost always produce recommendations that reflect a worldview more ``precautionary'' than the ``Promethean'' outlook more common among governing elites. There are good structural reasons for this difference. Its existence raises the question of why elites sponsor mini-publics and if policy is little affected by the results of deliberations, questions the possibility of deliberative legitimation of public policy. We make this argument by looking at mini-publics (where possible, a common consensus conference design) on GM foods in France, the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and Switzerland. Deliberative legitimation becomes plausible if elites can attenuate their Promethean outlook. This is possible if ecological modernization discourse pervades their politics; Denmark provides an illustration.},

It links current action-oriented time horizons to Earth historical deep time and implies non-separability of natures-cultures. The Anthropocene concept has resonated in debates in natural and social sciences, the humanities and the broader public, serving as an inter- and transdisciplinary bridging concept. Based on an analysis of numerous texts from multiple scientific disciplines and media, this contribution distinguishes five narratives of the Anthropocene: the disaster narrative, the court narrative, the Great Transformation narrative, the (bio-)technological and the interdependence narrative. The five narratives articulate very different perspectives and experiences and transport divergent political, economic, ethical and anthropological values and interests; this is also shown in alternative conceptualizations such as Eurocene, Technocene, Capitalocene or Plantationocene. The analysis reveals that the narratives share significant structural characteristics concerning story, plot, protagonists, spatial and temporal structure and action-oriented emplotment which together can be referred to a meta-narrative of the Anthropocene. Since the partly overlapping, partly contradictory narratives compete for legitimation and dominance in science and the broader public, the findings raise the question whether this struggle will stabilize or undermine the Anthropocene meta-narrative in the long run.},

First comparisons of random designs with fractional factorial and D-efficient designs are based on fictitious data, first comparisons with fractional factorial and confounded factorial designs are restricted to theoretical considerations. The aim of this contribution is to compare different designs regarding their reliability and their internal validity. The benchmark for the empirical comparison is established by the estimators from a parsimonious full factorial design, each answered by a sample of 132 students (real instead of fictitious data). Multilevel analyses confirm that, if they exist, balanced confounded factorial designs are ideal.

The intention here is to (1)␣provide a brief overview of the structure and strengths of ISCT; (2) identify recurring themes in the extensive commentary on the theory including brief mention of how ISCT has been applied outside the business ethics literature; (3) describe where research appears to be headed; and (4) specify challenges faced by those who seek to reform ISCT. Key themes in the critiquing literature relate to (a) the identification process for hypernorms; (b) justification of the recognition of hypernorms; (c) proposals for considering meso or meta norms; (d)␣clarification of the relationship between stakeholder concepts and ISCT; (e) problems with potentially unoccupied moral free space; (f) sources of ethical obligation within the ISCT framework; and (g) the potential role for concepts of stakeholder dialogue and engagement.},

The new scale, termed the New Ecological Paradigm Scale, consists of 15 items. Results of a 1990 Washington State survey suggest that the items can be treated as an internally consistent summated ratingscale and also indicate a modest growth in pro-NEP responses among Washington residents over the 14 years since the original study.},

The first three narratives of lay ethics do not take stock of what has radically changed in the modern world under the triple and joint evolution of science, religion, and philosophy. The modern narratives, in turn, are in serious need of a post-modern deconstruction. Both critiques express the limits of humanism. They do not imply, however, that these narratives should not be taken seriously. In particular, the enduring presence of three ancient narratives in laypeople's symbolic thought is highly significant in terms of the role that the logic of the sacred keeps playing in the workings of modern societies. Lay people's implicit understanding of how modern technology tends towards catastrophe and apocalypse provides the strongest argument for taking these narratives seriously.},

  abstract = {Fast snapping in the carnivorous Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) involves trap lobe bending and abrupt curvature inversion (snap-buckling), but how do these traps reopen? Here, the trap reopening mechanics in two different D. muscipula clones, producing normal-sized (N traps, max. {$\approx$}3 cm in length) and large traps (L traps, max. {$\approx$}4.5 cm in length) are investigated. Time-lapse experiments reveal that both N and L traps can reopen by smooth and continuous outward lobe bending, but only L traps can undergo smooth bending followed by a much faster snap-through of the lobes. Additionally, L traps can reopen asynchronously, with one of the lobes moving before the other. This study challenges the current consensus on trap reopening, which describes it as a slow, smooth process driven by hydraulics and cell growth and/or expansion. Based on the results gained via three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC), morphological and mechanical investigations, the differences in trap reopening are proposed to stem from a combination of size and slenderness of individual traps. This study elucidates trap reopening processes in the (in)famous Dionaea snap traps \textendash{} unique shape-shifting structures of great interest for plant biomechanics, functional morphology, and applications in biomimetics, i.e., soft robotics.},

  abstract = {Walking in insects and most six-legged robots requires simultaneous control of up to 18 joints. Moreover, the number of joints that are mechanically coupled via body and ground varies from one moment to the next, and external conditions such as friction, compliance and slope of the substrate are often unpredictable. Thus, walking behaviour requires adaptive, context-dependent control of many degrees of freedom. As a consequence, modelling legged locomotion addresses many aspects of any motor behaviour in general. Based on results from behavioural experiments on arthropods, we describe a kinematic model of hexapod walking: the distributed artificial neural network controller walknet. Conceptually, the model addresses three basic problems in legged locomotion. (I) First, coordination of several legs requires coupling between the step cycles of adjacent legs, optimising synergistic propulsion, but ensuring stability through flexible adjustment to external disturbances. A set of behaviourally derived leg coordination rules can account for decentralised generation of different gaits, and allows stable walking of the insect model as well as of a number of legged robots. (II) Second, a wide range of different leg movements must be possible, e.g. to search for foothold, grasp for objects or groom the body surface. We present a simple neural network controller that can simulate targeted swing trajectories, obstacle avoidance reflexes and cyclic searching-movements. (III) Third, control of mechanically coupled joints of the legs in stance is achieved by exploiting the physical interactions between body, legs and substrate. A local positive displacement feedback, acting on individual leg joints, transforms passive displacement of a joint into active movement, generating synergistic assistance reflexes in all mechanically coupled joints.},

  abstract = {Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.},

A fairly representative Swedish sample (N = 2911) rated the acceptability of 44 environmental policies. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that participants' acceptability of policies forms three categories: push policies consisting of regulatory and market-based disincentives, pull policies consisting mainly of market-based incentives, and informational policies, such as ecolabeling. Sociodemographics had small but consistent effects on attitudes towards the three categories, while political ideology had a larger effect across the categories. This study indicates that current academic categorisations may not adequately capture laypeople's perceptions, and discusses the importance of research on driving mechanisms behind the current taxonomy.},

The investigations on soft materials are mostly done for two reasons: (a) to develop an anthropomorphic/prosthetic hand or soft hand with human skin-like material to perform soft manipulations and (b) to develop soft actuators. This paper presented a comprehensive investigation into researches on soft materials for robotic applications. The primary interest of using soft materials is not to leave any marks or damage to objects during the manipulation. The other advantage would be stable grasping due to an area contact. Natural rubber, synthetic rubber, elastomer, polymer composite and nanoparticulated polymer composite are some existing soft materials. Extensive research is required to prepare a high-strength but lighter soft material for robotic soft manipulation. Human skin and its mechanical properties are initially discussed. In addition, the need of soft material for soft manipulations and observations from previous researches over the past few decades, modelling of non-linear hyperelastic/viscoelastic materials and characterization are discussed. Finally, various soft materials including the polymer-matrix composites, available fillers and their advantages, processing methods and nanoparticulated polymer matrix and its significance in robotic application are presented.},

Thinking and feeling are inextricably interrelated most of the time: Certain ways of interpreting one's environment are inherently emotional, few thoughts are entirely free of feelings, and emotions influence thinking. Reason and passion are not independent domains, or are rarely so. Of course there are exceptions: Brain stimulation, hormones, and drugs can produce emotions without external environmental circumstances, just as they can produce sensations, cognitions, and ideas without external environmental circumstances (Penfield, 1975). The fact that exceptions exist does not mean that there is no rule. The general rule suggested by appraisal theorists is that emotions consist of patterns of perception, or rather interpretation, and their correlates in the central and peripheral nervous systems (see Ellsworth, 1994c; Roseman \& Smith, 2001; Scherer, 2001a, 2001b).

These factors are mediated by affect and perceived effects, including perceived benefits, costs and risks. We tested the applicability of our model across three different energy technologies: hydrogen fuel stations, biofuel production plants and stationary battery storage facilities. Our study confirms previous findings, which stress the relevance of psychological and social factors. It also extends the literature, testing a universal model across different technologies and examining acceptance on both the local and the general level.

In this framework, psychological variables are understood to directly affect each other rather than being caused by an unobserved latent entity. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on posttraumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.

Here, using data from four independent samples, each with approximately 90,000 international respondents to the 100-item HEXACO Personality Inventory-Revised (HEXACO-PI-R), we demonstrated that a five-profile solution fit the data well. Exploratory analyses suggested that this solution was also consistent across gender and age groups. The five-profile structure replicated well with larger subsamples, but could not be reproduced consistently with samples of fewer than 500 individuals. However, even with small samples, the five-profile structure could be applied using the parameters obtained with the larger samples. We used HEXACO theory along with agency\textendash communion and attachment theories to offer preliminary explanations and labels for the five profiles. We discuss how these theories, combined with parameter estimates provided by our research, can be used to generate and test hypotheses to validate the five-profile structure and evaluate its utility for personality research and other applications.},

So far, few examples from the huge pool of natural models have been examined and transferred to technical applications. Like living organisms, subsequent generations of soft machines will autonomously respond, sense, and adapt to the environment. Plants as concept generators remain relatively unexplored in biomimetic approaches to robotics and related technologies, despite being able to grow, and continuously adapt in response to environmental stimuli. In this research review, we highlight recent developments in plant-inspired soft machine systems based on movement principles. We focus on inspirations taken from fast active movements in the carnivorous Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and compare current developments in artificial Venus flytraps with their biological role model. The advantages and disadvantages of current systems are also analyzed and discussed, and a new state-of-the-art autonomous system is derived. Incorporation of the basic structural and functional principles of the Venus flytrap into novel autonomous applications in the field of robotics not only will inspire further plant-inspired biomimetic developments but might also advance contemporary plant-inspired robots, leading to fully autonomous systems utilizing bioinspired working concepts.},

In this paper we explore the tension between different rationales for widening participation and examine their implications for its practice. Taking debates about medical genomics in the UK as an illustrative example, we argue that more heterogeneous participation and debate have the potential to improve the scrutiny and accountability of science within representative democracies. In doing so we also argue that it is necessary to replace the language of `lay expertise' with a more systematic and rigorous treatment of the expertise or its absence that characterizes different participants. Drawing on the theoretical work of Collins \& Evans (2002), we distinguish between those processes where expert knowledge is required and debate is conducted within the public domain, rather than by the public itself, and those where the views of non-expert lay citizens are needed and valued. The effect of adopting this approach is to permit a more inclusive treatment of the `technical' while also providing a positive role for non-expert citizens in the democratic control and oversight of science.},

A growing number of authors are currently discussing how the quality of mixed methods research should be conceptualised and operationalised, with the ultimate aim of promoting well designed and properly implemented mixed methods studies. These authors argue that mixed methods research has a number of unique features with respect to monomethod research and, as such, should be appraised according to its own set of quality criteria. Based on a systematic search of the literature, this review (1) examines the features and trends of the literature on the quality of mixed methods research published until February 2016; (2) provides a metasummary of the most prevalent quality criteria suggested in this literature; and (3) proposes a number of recommendations for future discussion and research on this topic. The review concludes that (1) publications on the quality of mixed methods research are increasingly more prevalent and elaborated; (2) a shared set of core quality criteria for appraising mixed methods research can be identified across publications; and (3) future work on this topic should focus on increasing the number of empirical publications on quality, achieving greater consistency in quality terminology, and reaching an agreement on core quality criteria.},

This paper presents the results of survey experiments testing whether hearing about solar radiation management (SRM) affects people's support for taxing polluting energy and/or their trust in climate science. For a nationally representative sample of respondents in Britain, I found that receiving a brief introduction to SRM had no impact on most people's willingness to pay taxes, nor on their trust in climate science. Hearing about this form of geoengineering therefore appears unlikely to erode support for emissions reductions. Specifically for political conservatives asked first about paying taxes, moreover, hearing about SRM increased trust in climate science. These and other results of the experiments also provide partial support for the theory that conservatives' lower trust in climate science generally stems from their aversion to regulatory action by the state.},

Growing concerns, in particular, are expressed for policies that reward ``quantity'' at the expense of ``quality,'' because these might prompt scientists to unduly multiply their publications by fractioning (``salami slicing''), duplicating, rushing, simplifying, or even fabricating their results. To assess the reasonableness of these concerns, we analyzed publication patterns of over 40,000 researchers that, between the years 1900 and 2013, have published two or more papers within 15 years, in any of the disciplines covered by the Web of Science. The total number of papers published by researchers during their early career period (first fifteen years) has increased in recent decades, but so has their average number of co-authors. If we take the latter factor into account, by measuring productivity fractionally or by only counting papers published as first author, we observe no increase in productivity throughout the century. Even after the 1980s, adjusted productivity has not increased for most disciplines and countries. These results are robust to methodological choices and are actually conservative with respect to the hypothesis that publication rates are growing. Therefore, the widespread belief that pressures to publish are causing the scientific literature to be flooded with salami-sliced, trivial, incomplete, duplicated, plagiarized and false results is likely to be incorrect or at least exaggerated.},

  abstract = {The best combination of possible climate policy options (mitigation, adaptation and different climate engineering technologies) to tackle climate change is unknown. Climate policy is facing a hard decision in answering the question whether climate engineering technologies should be researched, limitedly deployed or even deployed at global scale. Such technologies bear large epistemic and ethical uncertainties and their use as well as non-use might have severe consequences. To deal with such uncertainties, the (ethical) assessment of climate engineering technologies should include the perspectives of various stakeholders including laypersons to inform climate policy. To facilitate (ethical) technology assessment, we propose a novel 2-step methodology to collect and analyze data on ethical concerns and the acceptability of climate engineering technologies. Thereby we focus on Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) as an use case. We propose an innovative combination of newly developed methods consisting of two data collection tools (Cognitive-Affective Mapping and large-scale survey) and two types of data analyses (using graph theory and factor analysis). Applying this multi-method approach we were able to identify (1) central ethical and governance related concerns regarding SAI (by Cognitive-Affective Maps) and (2) to estimate the relative importance of core constructs (positive and negative affect, risk and benefit perception, trust) on the acceptability of SAI (by large-scale survey).},

These procedures can be sensibly used to examine the degree to which a third variable (Z) accounts for the influence of an independent (X) on a dependent variable (Y) conditional on the assumption that Z actually is a mediator. However, conversely, a significant mediation analysis result does not prove that Z is a mediator. This obvious but often neglected insight is substantiated in a simulation study. Using different causal models for generating Z (genuine mediator, spurious mediator, correlate of the dependent measure, manipulation check) it is shown that significant mediation tests do not allow researchers to identify unique mediators, or to distinguish between alternative causal models. This basic insight, although well understood by experts in statistics, is persistently ignored in the empirical literature and in the reviewing process of even the most selective journals. \textcopyright{} 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Next you discover the importance of exploring and graphing data, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for example correlation and regression). You will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as ANOVA, before ending your journey with advanced techniques such as MANOVA and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help you gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what you're doing, the emphasis is on applying what you learn to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than you might expect.~Like its sister textbooks, Discovering Statistics Using R is written in an irreverent style and follows the same ground-breaking structure and pedagogical approach. The core material is augmented by a cast of characters to help the reader on their way, together with hundreds of examples, self-assessment tests to consolidate knowledge, and additional website material for those wanting to learn more at: Instructor Site.~Given this book's accessibility, fun spirit, and use of bizarre real-world research it should be essential for anyone wanting to learn about statistics using the freely-available R software.},

We propose that this relationship occurs because people rely on affect when judging the risk and benefit of specific hazards. Evidence supporting this proposal is obtained in two experimental studies. Study 1 investigated the inverse relationship between risk and benefit judgments under a time-pressure condition designed to limit the use of analytic thought and enhance the reliance on affect. As expected, the inverse relationship was strengthened when time pressure was introduced. Study 2 tested and confirmed the hypothesis that providing information designed to alter the favorability of one's overall affective evaluation of an item (say nuclear power) would systematically change the risk and benefit judgments for that item. Both studies suggest that people seem prone to using an `affect heuristic' which improves judgmental efficiency by deriving both risk and benefit evaluations from a common source\textemdash affective reactions to the stimulus item.

Claude Fischer presents the first social history of this vital but little-studied technology\textemdash how we encountered, tested, and ultimately embraced it with enthusiasm.

Women were especially avid in their use, a phenomenon which the industry first vigorously discouraged and then later wholeheartedly promoted. Again and again Fischer finds that the telephone supported a wide-ranging network of social relations and played a crucial role in community life, especially for women, from organizing children's relationships and church activities to alleviating the loneliness and boredom of rural life.Deftly written and meticulously researched, America Calling adds an important new chapter to the social history of our nation and illuminates a fundamental aspect of cultural modernism that is integral to contemporary life.},

When asked by students or junior researchers for references to the Rasch model, it was a typical reaction on the part of the editors to state that it was difficult to name one, or just a few; actually, only a whole list of references differing in notation and level of formal abstraction seemed to meet the request in most cases. Therefore, in 1992 the editors decided to invite a number of outstanding authors in the field of Rasch modeling to contribute to a book presenting the current state of knowledge about Rasch models. The aim was not just to collect a number of papers on the subject, rather to produce a well-organized monograph. To this end, a workshop was held in Vienna from 25 to 27 February 1993 in which, after a process of mutual reviewing, drafts of all chapters were read and discussed by all authors, leading to a more systematic organization of the topics treated in unified notation and terminology. (The workshop was sponsored by the University of Vienna; here, the editors would like to express their thanks, in the name of all contributors, both for the financial support and for the hospitality granted.},

Doubts arise for a host of reasons, including a lack of transparency, ignorance, negligence, or misrepresentation of the evidence. We describe the scope of the problem and focus on how transparency is a part of the solution. A lack of measurement transparency makes it impossible to evaluate potential threats to internal, external, statistical-conclusion, and construct validity. We demonstrate that psychology is plagued by a measurement schmeasurement attitude: QMPs are common, hide a stunning source of researcher degrees of freedom, and pose a serious threat to cumulative psychological science, but are largely ignored. We address these challenges by providing a set of questions that researchers and consumers of scientific research can consider to identify and avoid QMPs. Transparent answers to these measurement questions promote rigorous research, allow for thorough evaluations of a study's inferences, and are necessary for meaningful replication studies.},

  abstract = {Finding ways to understand the nature of social change and social order-from political movements to market meltdowns-is one of the enduring problems of social science. A Theory of Fields draws together far-ranging insights from social movement theory, organizational theory, and economic and political sociology to construct a general theory of social organization and strategic action. In a work of remarkable synthesis, imagination, and analysis, Neil Fligstein and Doug McAdam propose that social change and social order can be understood through what they call strategic action fields. They posit that these fields are the general building blocks of political and economic life, civil society, and the state, and the fundamental form of order in our world today. Similar to Russian dolls, they are nested and connected in a broader environment of almost countless proximate and overlapping fields. Fields are mutually dependent; change in one often triggers change in another. At the core of the theory is an account of how social actors fashion and maintain order in a given field. This sociological theory of action, what they call "social skill," helps explain what individuals do in strategic action fields to gain cooperation or engage in competition. To demonstrate the breadth of the theory, Fligstein and McAdam make its abstract principles concrete through extended case studies of the Civil Rights Movement and the rise and fall of the market for mortgages in the U.S. since the 1960s. The book also provides a "how-to" guide to help others implement the approach and discusses methodological issues. With a bold new approach, A Theory of Fields offers both a rigorous and practically applicable way of thinking through and making sense of social order and change-and how one emerges from the other-in modern, complex societies.},

Yet, partly owing to the complexity of these procedures, confusion persists among psychologists with respect to the implementation of EFA and CFA. Primary among these misunderstandings is the very mathematical distinction between EFA and CFA. The current paper uses a brief example to illustrate the difference between the statistical models underlying EFA and CFA, both of which are particular instantiations of the more general common factor model. Next, important considerations for the implementation of EFA and CFA discussed in this paper include the need to account for the categorical nature of item-level observed variables in factor analyses, the use of factor analysis in studies of the psychometric properties of new tests or questionnaires and previously developed tests, decisions about whether to use EFA or CFA in these contexts, and the importance of replication of factor analytic models in the ongoing pursuit of validation.

Previous researchers have thoroughly written about much of the details already, including the philosophy underlying Bayesian methods, computational issues associated with Bayesian model estimation, Bayesian model development and summary, and the role of Bayesian methods in the so-called replication crisis. In this paper, we seek to provide case studies comparing the use of frequentist methods to the use of Bayesian methods in applied psychological research. These case studies are intended to `illustrate by example' the ways that Bayesian modelling differs from frequentist modelling and the differing conclusions that one may arrive at using the two methods. The intended audience is applied psychological researchers who have been trained in the traditional frequentist framework, who are familiar with mixed-effects models and who are curious about how statistical results might look in a Bayesian context. Along with our case studies, we provide general opinions and guidance on the use of Bayesian methods in applied psychological research.},

This article examines several existing EFA methodologies currently in use.

  abstract = {`Stories' used to communicate climate change knowledge shape opinions and preferences, and analyzing such narratives can help explain how they are constructed and how they influence us on personal and societal scales. The narrative perspective makes it possible to identify the presence or absence of typical components in a `story,' such as initial situation, complication, reaction(s), resolution, and final situation, and to identify different actors or narrative characters (heroes, villains, victims). This article reviews the notions of narratives and frames, describes narrative analysis generally and more specifically how a text linguistic perspective can benefit from and contribute to the Narrative Policy Framework in narrative analysis. It illustrates how different approaches can be applied as analytical tools to explore the effects of conflicting narratives (frames) on public opinion of and attitudes towards climate change. Applied to various text genres, the analysis identifies different components of the `stories,' at overarching levels of the text as a whole and at microlevels such as sentences. This may have rhetorical implications, as controversial points of view can be hidden from critical assessment through the condensation of narrative components into short expressions. When exposed to conflicting `stories,' people get a diverse picture of climate change, a diversity which may, however, also lead to confusion about how to react. Concerning the narrative characters, recent research indicates that a clear hero role has a large persuasive impact. More experiments testing how people interpret various narratives should be undertaken in an interdisciplinary perspective, combining social science, and linguistic approaches.

The WA, measured at different phases of diverse kinds of therapies, has been shown to robustly predict posttreatment outcomes. But the way the clients' conceptualization of the alliance evolves overtime, and the relation between this kind of conceptual change and subsequent symptom improvements, has not been investigated. Dynamic Latent Class Structural Equation Models (DLC-SEM) were applied to data drawn from two randomized clinical trials of cognitive-behavioral therapy for generalized anxiety disorder (N = 57 and 80) to evaluate several potential models of the relation between the conceptual/structural changes in patients' self-reports of the quality of the alliance and subsequent treatment outcomes. Inspection of the DLC-SEM models suggests that, overtime, between 63\% and 66\% of the better session-level outcome clients switched from three factors (task, goal, bond) to an integrated single factor conceptualization of the therapeutic alliance. The study indicates that the majority of patients evolve their concept of the alliance overtime: The previously distinct alliance elements become integrated into a single factor construct. These findings suggest that if such overtime development is generalizable across diverse patient/treatment populations, future research ought to take these developments into account both methodologically (i.e., how alliance is measured) and in analyzing time-series data (e.g., using DLC-SEM). By modeling the patient's dynamic concept evolution, this initial study shows a potential to empirically explore prior theoretical propositions of the evolutions (or stability) of the alliance overtime.

It explicates a rationale for anticipatory governance and its three conditions: foresight, engagement, and integration. The chapter suggests that starting in the mid-1970s there has been some evolution of theory, practice, and policy towards an explicit commitment to anticipatory governance to address the uncertain futures of emerging technologies. Anticipatory governance provides a set of tools for focusing that attention in ways that are unavailable in the larger climate change discourses. Evaluating the reports' recommendations against anticipatory governance, we find that all five articulate foresight, engagement, and integration as high-level principles. Specifying the societal goals for those actively pursuing geoengineering research would provide an alternative evaluation scheme or a new mechanism to assess "progress".},

The Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ), which assesses degree of idealism and rejection of universal moral rules in favor of relativism, was developed to measure the extent to which individuals adopt one of the ideologies. 241 university students were Ss. The 2 scales that make up the EPQ were found to have adequate internal consistency, were reliable over time, were not correlated with social desirability, and were not related to scores on the Defining Issues Test. The Relativism scale did correlate with scores on the Survey of Ethical Attitudes. When the scales were used to classify Ss into one of the ideologies, predictions concerning differences in each ideology's moral judgment processes were supported.

However, there are methodological challenges and issues to consider concerning how web probing is best implemented. In this chapter, some of the issues we address experimentally pertain to placement of the web probes and the type of information solicited from web probes. Specifically, we examined both quantitative and qualitative metrics of response output based on placement and probe type. Across two experiments, we found that probe placement did not strongly influence either the quantity or quality of responses produced. We also obtained indications that web probes provided information that is similar to that from standard cognitive interviews. Based on the data from these experiments, and from our review of the existing literature, we make several recommendations for best practices and highlight considerations when using web probes. We conclude that web probing is a useful component of our QDET toolbox and will continue to adapt as technology platforms and capabilities evolve.},

  abstract = {The modeling of item response data is governed by item response theory, also referred to as modern test theory. The eld of inquiry of item response theory has become very large and shows the enormous progress that has been made. The mainstream literature is focused on frequentist statistical methods for - timating model parameters and evaluating model t. However, the Bayesian methodology has shown great potential, particularly for making further - provements in the statistical modeling process. The Bayesian approach has two important features that make it attractive for modeling item response data. First, it enables the possibility of incorpor- ing nondata information beyond the observed responses into the analysis. The Bayesian methodology is also very clear about how additional information can be used. Second, the Bayesian approach comes with powerful simulation-based estimation methods. These methods make it possible to handle all kinds of priors and data-generating models. One of my motives for writing this book is to give an introduction to the Bayesian methodology for modeling and analyzing item response data. A Bayesian counterpart is presented to the many popular item response theory books (e.g., Baker and Kim 2004; De Boeck and Wilson, 2004; Hambleton and Swaminathan, 1985; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1997) that are mainly or completely focused on frequentist methods. The usefulness of the Bayesian methodology is illustrated by discussing and applying a range of Bayesian item response models.},

Results of multiple studies (n {$>$} 1500) showed that the scale achieves good to excellent reliability, exhibits expected moderate to high correlations with geekism, technology enthusiasm, NFC, self-reported success in technical problem-solving and technical system learning success, and also with usage of technical systems. Further, correlations of ATI with the Big Five personality dimensions were weak at most. Based on the results, the ATI scale appears to be a promising tool for research applications such as the characterization of user diversity in system usability tests and the construction of general models of user-technology interaction.},

However, it is hard to be an expert in everything. To help HRI researchers develop methodological skills, especially in areas that are relatively new to them, we conducted a virtual workshop, Workshop Your Study Design (WYSD), at the 2021 International Conference on HRI. In this workshop, we grouped participants with mentors, who are experts in areas like real-world studies, empirical lab studies, questionnaire design, interview, participatory design, and statistics. During and after the workshop, participants discussed their proposed study methods, obtained feedback, and improved their work accordingly. In this paper, we present 1) Workshop attendees' feedback about the workshop and 2) Lessons that the participants learned during their discussions with mentors. Participants' responses about the workshop were positive, and future scholars who wish to run such a workshop can consider implementing their suggestions. The main contribution of this paper is the lessons learned section, where the workshop participants contributed to forming this section based on what participants discovered during the workshop. We organize lessons learned into themes of 1) Improving study design for HRI, 2) How to work with participants - especially children -, 3) Making the most of the study and robot's limitations, and 4) How to collaborate well across fields as they were the areas of the papers submitted to the workshop. These themes include practical tips and guidelines to assist researchers to learn about fields of HRI research with which they have limited experience. We include specific examples, and researchers can adapt the tips and guidelines to their own areas to avoid some common mistakes and pitfalls in their research.},

Various psychological theories have put forth a series of candidate correlates, yet the strength and robustness of their associations remain unclear because of disparate operationalizations of risk preference and analytic limitations in past research. We addressed these issues with a study involving several operationalizations of risk preference (all collected from each participant in a diverse sample of the German population; N = 916), and by adopting an exhaustive modeling approach\textemdash specification curve analysis. Our analyses of 6 candidate correlates (household income, sex, age, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, years of education) suggest that sex and age have robust and consistent associations with risk preference, whereas the other candidate correlates show weaker and more (domain-) specific associations (except for crystallized intelligence, for which there were no robust associations). The results further demonstrate the important role of construct operationalization when assessing people's risk preferences: Self-reported propensity measures picked up various associations with the proposed correlates, but (incentivized) behavioral measures largely failed to do so. In short, the associations between the 6 candidate correlates and risk preference depend mostly on how risk preference is measured, rather than whether and which control variables are included in the model specifications. The present findings inform several theories that have suggested candidate correlates of risk preference, and illustrate how personality research may profit from exhaustive modeling techniques to improve theory and measurement of essential constructs.

They are now standard features in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB.NET and C\# (and any language using the .NET Framework), PHP, and MySQL.  If you don't use regular expressions yet, you will discover in this book a whole new world of mastery over your data. If you already use them, you'll appreciate this book's unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage. If you think you know all you need to know about regular expressions, this book is a stunning eye-opener.  As this book shows, a command of regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Regular expressions allow you to code complex and subtle text processing that you never imagined could be automated. Regular expressions can save you time and aggravation. They can be used to craft elegant solutions to a wide range of problems. Once you've mastered regular expressions, they'll become an invaluable part of your toolkit. You will wonder how you ever got by without them.  Yet despite their wide availability, flexibility, and unparalleled power, regular expressions are frequently underutilized. Yet what is power in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the unwary. Mastering Regular Expressions will help you navigate the minefield to becoming an expert and help you optimize your use of regular expressions.   Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition, now includes a full chapter devoted to PHP and its powerful and expressive suite of regular expression functions, in addition to enhanced PHP coverage in the central "core" chapters. Furthermore, this edition has been updated throughout to reflect advances in other languages, including expanded in-depth coverage of Sun's java.util.regex package, which has emerged as the standard Java regex implementation.Topics include: A comparison of features among different versions of many languages and tools How the regular expression engine works Optimization (major savings available here!) Matching just what you want, but not what you don't want Sections and chapters on individual languages  Written in the lucid, entertaining tone that makes a complex, dry topic become crystal-clear to programmers, and sprinkled with solutions to complex real-world problems, Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition offers a wealth information that you can put to immediate use. Reviews of this new edition and the second edition: "There isn't a better (or more useful) book available on regular expressions."  --Zak Greant, Managing Director, eZ Systems  "A real tour-de-force of a book which not only covers the mechanics of regexes in extraordinary detail but also talks about efficiency and the use of regexes in Perl, Java, and .NET...If you use regular expressions as part of your professional work (even if you already have a good book on whatever language you're programming in) I would strongly recommend this book to you."  --Dr. Chris Brown, Linux Format   "The author does an outstanding job leading the reader from regex novice to master. The book is extremely easy to read and chock full of useful and relevant examples...Regular expressions are valuable tools that every developer should have in their toolbox. Mastering Regular Expressions is the definitive guide to the subject, and an outstanding resource that belongs on every programmer's bookshelf. Ten out of Ten Horseshoes."  --Jason Menard, Java Ranch},

  abstract = {Mounting evidence that even aggressive reductions in net emissions of greenhouse gases will be insufficient to limit global climate risks is increasing calls for atmospheric experiments to better understand the risks and implications of also deploying solar geoengineering technologies to reflect sunlight and rapidly lower surface temperatures. But solar geoengineering research itself poses significant environmental and geopolitical risks. Given limited societal awareness and public dialogue about this climate response option, conducting such experiments without meaningful societal engagement could galvanize opposition to solar geoengineering research from civil society, including the most climate vulnerable communities who are among its intended beneficiaries. Here, we explore whether and how a solar geoengineering research enterprise might be developed in a way that promotes legitimacy as well as scientific credibility and policy relevance. We highlight the distinctive responsibilities of researchers and research funders to ensure that solar geoengineering research proposals are subject to legitimate societal review and scrutiny, recommend steps they can take to strive towards legitimacy and call on them to be explicitly open to multiple potential outcomes, including the societal rejection or considerable alteration of the solar geoengineering research enterprise.

Postnormal science is appropriate when either attribute is high; then the traditional methodologies are ineffective. In those circumstances, the quality assurance of scientific inputs to the policy process requires an `extended peer community', consisting of all those with a stake in the dialogue on the issue.

  abstract = {Climate change is arguably the great problem confronting humanity, but we have done little to head off this looming catastrophe. In The Perfect Moral Storm, philosopher Stephen Gardiner illuminates our dangerous inaction by placing the environmental crisis in an entirely new light, considering it as an ethical failure. Gardiner clarifies the moral situation, identifying the temptations (or "storms") that make us vulnerable to a certain kind of corruption. First, the world's most affluent nations are tempted to pass on the cost of climate change to the poorer and weaker citizens of the world. Second, the present generation is tempted to pass the problem on to future generations. Third, our poor grasp of science, international justice, and the human relationship to nature helps to facilitate inaction. As a result, we are engaging in willful self-deception when the lives of future generations, the world's poor, and even the basic fabric of life on the planet is at stake. We should wake up to this profound ethical failure, Gardiner concludes, and demand more of our institutions, our leaders and ourselves. "This is a radical book, both in the sense that it faces extremes and in the sense that it goes to the roots." --Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews "The book's strength lies in Gardiner's success at understanding and clarifying the types of moral issues that climate change raises, which is an important first step toward solutions." --Science Magazine "Gardiner has expertly explored some very instinctual and vitally important considerations which cannot realistically be ignored. --Required reading." --Green Prophet "Gardiner makes a strong case for highlighting and insisting on the ethical dimensions of the climate problem, and his warnings about buck-passing and the dangerous appeal of moral corruptions hit home." --Times Higher Education "Stephen Gardiner takes to a new level our understanding of the moral dimensions of climate change. A Perfect Moral Storm argues convincingly that climate change is the greatest moral challenge our species has ever faced - and that the problem goes even deeper than we think." --Peter Singer, Princeton University},

The ethical considerations driving perception of technology have to do with privacy, the proportionality principle, harm and safety. People accepting the technology do not mention such constructs, they focus on the possibility of being pioneers and the convenience offered by the technology. Societal acceptance, through the gaze of others and the infrastructure developed in the different countries to use microchips, also plays a role to drive personal and work-related acceptance of insideables.

  abstract = {Self-report measures arguably represent one of the most important research tools in social and personality psychology. To measure people's attitudes, beliefs, and personality characteristics, it seems rather straightforward to simply ask them about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Yet, researchers are well aware that people are sometimes unwilling or unable to provide accurate reports of their own psychological attributes. In socially sensitive domains, for example, responses on self-report measures are often distorted by social desirability and self-presentational concerns. Similarly, the value of self-report measures seems limited for psychological attributes that are introspectively inaccessible or outside of conscious awareness. To overcome these limitations, psychologists have developed alternative measurement instruments that reduce participants' ability to control their responses and do not require introspection for the assessment of psychological attributes. In social and personality psychology, such measurement instruments are commonly referred to as implicit measures, whereas traditional self-report measures are often described as explicit measures. The main goal of the current chapter is to provide a general introduction to the use and meaning of implicit measures in social and personality psychology. Toward this end, we first explain what implicit measures are and in which sense they may be described as implicit. We then provide an overview of the currently available paradigms, including descriptions of their basic procedures and some recommendations on how to choose among the various measures. Expanding on this overview, we outline the kinds of insights that can be gained from implicit measures for understanding the determinants of behavior, biases in information processing, and the formation and change of mental representations. In the final two sections we discuss some caveats regarding the interpretation of implicit measures and potential directions for future developments.

  abstract = {For years psychologists across many subfields have undertaken the formidable challenge of designing survey scales to assess attitudes, opinions, and behaviors. Correspondingly, scholars have written much to guide researchers in this undertaking. Yet, many new scales violate established best practices in survey design, suggesting the need for a new approach to designing surveys. This article presents 6 steps to facilitate the construction of questionnaire scales. Unlike previous processes, this one front loads input from other academics and potential respondents in the item-development and revision phase with the goal of achieving credibility across both populations. Specifically, the article describes how (a) a literature review and (b) focus group?interview data can be (c) synthesized into a comprehensive list to facilitate (d) the development of items. Next, survey designers can subject the items to (e) an expert review and (f) cognitive pretesting before executing a pilot test.},

Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary\textemdash for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from a 5.1\% significance level to 4.9\%, thus moving it into statistical significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changes in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities.The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problems\textemdash that statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed differences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that students and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between ``significant'' and ``not significant'' is not itself statistically significant.},

To better understand climate change deniers, we considered the relationship between climate change denial and environmentalism constructs through an individual differences perspective. We aimed to identify the personality traits associated with climate change denial, environmental self-concept, and pro-environmental behaviours. We measured personality using the Big Five Aspect Scales. Using hierarchical multiple regressions, we determined the personality profile that predicts climate change denial, ecological self-concept, and pro-environmental behaviour. At the domain level, the Openness/Intellect domain significantly predicted each of the environmental constructs, and the Agreeableness domain was predictive of ecological self-concept and climate change acceptance. At the aspect level, the Openness aspect was the primary personality predictor for each construct. Our results demonstrate that aspect level analyses could be more efficacious than domain level analysis, as they have greater specificity and explanatory power.},

  abstract = {As reflected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do ``rational'' decisions as defined by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (``Which heuristics do people use in which situations?'') and the prescriptive question (``When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?''), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.

Conditional on preexisting societal tensions and socioeconomic vulnerabilities, we isolate effects on economic performance, income and livelihood, food and energy prices, and land tenure as most likely to increase conflict risks. Climate policy designs may be critical to moderate these risks as different designs can promote more favorable societal outcomes such as equity and inclusion. Coupling research with careful monitoring and evaluation of the intermediate societal effects at early stages of policy implementation will be a critical part of learning and moderating potential conflict risks. Importantly, better characterizing the future conflict risks under climate policy allows for a more comprehensive comparison to the conflict risk if mitigation is not implemented and graver climate damages are experienced.

ChatGPT is an impressive, easy-to-use, publicly accessible system demonstrating the power of large language models such as GPT-4. Other compa- rable generative models are available for text processing, images, audio, video, and other outputs - and we expect a massive further performance increase, integration in larger software systems, and diffusion in the coming years. This technological development triggers substantial uncertainty and change in university-level teaching and learning. Students ask questions like: How can ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence tools support me? Am I allowed to use ChatGPT for a seminar or final paper, or is that cheating? How exactly do I use ChatGPT best? Are there other ways to access models such as GPT-4? Given that such tools are here to stay, what skills should I acquire, and what is obsolete? Lecturers ask similar questions from a different perspective: What skills should I teach? How can I test students' competencies rather than their ability to prompt generative AI models? How can I use ChatGPT and other systems based on generative AI to increase my efficiency or even improve my students' learning experience and outcomes? Even if the current discussion revolves around ChatGPT and GPT-4, these are only the forerunners of what we can expect from future generative AI-based models and tools. So even if you think ChatGPT is not yet technically mature, it is worth looking into its impact on higher education. This is where this whitepaper comes in. It looks at ChatGPT as a contemporary example of a conversational user interface that leverages large language models. The whitepaper looks at ChatGPT from the perspective of students and lecturers. It focuses on everyday areas of higher education: teaching courses, learning for an exam, crafting seminar papers and theses, and assessing students' learning outcomes and performance. For this purpose, we consider the chances and concrete application possibilities, the limits and risks of ChatGPT, and the underlying large language models. (...)},

This is a descriptive review of interrater agreement and interrater reliability indices. It outlines the practical applications and interpretation of these indices in social and administrative pharmacy research. Interrater agreement indices assess the extent to which the responses of 2 or more independent raters are concordant. Interrater reliability indices assess the extent to which raters consistently distinguish between different responses. A number of indices exist, and some common examples include Kappa, the Kendall coefficient of concordance, Bland-Altman plots, and the intraclass correlation coefficient. Guidance on the selection of an appropriate index is provided. In conclusion, selection of an appropriate index to evaluate interrater agreement or interrater reliability is dependent on a number of factors including the context in which the study is being undertaken, the type of variable under consideration, and the number of raters making assessments.},

We analyze (1) The development of trust and SWB on the aggregate level; (2) The effect of trust on SWB on the individual cross-sectional level; and (3) The longitudinal and cross-sectional effect of trust on SWB on the aggregate level while considering control variables based on previous research. We observe a weak positive trend regarding social trust as well as SWB over time, but no significant change in institutional trust. However, trends are far from homogeneous across countries. In accordance to previous studies, we find a positive effect of social trust on SWB. This effect holds on the individual cross-sectional level for every participating country, but also on the longitudinal level. In view of institutional trust, we see a positive effect on SWB on the individual and aggregate cross-sectional level, but not over time. Thus, this study particularly sheds new light on this relation, indicating that it\textasciiacute s cross-sectional relation is due to confounding variables. Moreover, we observe no relation between economic growth and SWB after controlling for unemployment, but a positive effect of decreasing unemployment and inflation on SWB. Our data suggests that establishing an environment with high social trust across Europe would be rewarded with a happy society.},

We distinguish two forms of chunking: the first deliberate, under strategic control, and goal-oriented; the second automatic, continuous, and linked to perceptual processes. Recent work with discrimination-network computational models of long- and short-term memory (EPAM/CHREST) has produced a diverse range of applications of perceptual chunking. We focus on recent successes in verbal learning, expert memory, language acquisition and learning multiple representations, to illustrate the implementation and use of chunking mechanisms within contemporary models of human learning.},

  abstract = {In the 45 years since R. B. Cattell (1943, 1945) used English trait terms to begin the formulation of his "description of personality," a number of investigators have proposed an alternative structure based on 5 orthogonal factors. The generality of this 5-factor model is here demonstrated across unusually comprehensive sets of trait terms. In the 1st of 3 studies, 1,431 trait adjectives grouped into 75 clusters were analyzed; virtually identical structures emerged in 10 replications, each based on a different factor-analytic procedure. A 2nd study of 479 common terms grouped into 133 synonym clusters revealed the same structure in 2 samples of self-ratings and in 2 samples of peer ratings. None of the factors beyond the 5th generalized across the samples. In the 3rd study, analyses of 100 clusters derived from 339 trait terms suggest their potential utility as Big-Five markers in future studies.

  abstract = {Automated vehicles have received much attention recently, particularly the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Urban Challenge vehicles, Google's self-driving cars, and various others from auto manufacturers. These vehicles have the potential to reduce crashes and improve roadway efficiency significantly by automating the responsibilities of the driver. Still, automated vehicles are expected to crash occasionally, even when all sensors, vehicle control components, and algorithms function perfectly. If a human driver is unable to take control in time, a computer will be responsible for precrash behavior. Unlike other automated vehicles, such as aircraft, in which every collision is catastrophic, and unlike guided track systems, which can avoid collisions only in one dimension, automated roadway vehicles can predict various crash trajectory alternatives and select a path with the lowest damage or likelihood of collision. In some situations, the preferred path may be ambiguous. The study reported here investigated automated vehicle crashing and concluded the following: (a) automated vehicles would almost certainly crash, (b) an automated vehicle's decisions that preceded certain crashes had a moral component, and (c) there was no obvious way to encode complex human morals effectively in software. The paper presents a three-phase approach to develop ethical crashing algorithms; the approach consists of a rational approach, an artificial intelligence approach, and a natural language requirement. The phases are theoretical and should be implemented as the technology becomes available.},

This paper accumulates and analyzes extant multi-national and quantitative studies of these facets of global culture. The paper begins with a summary of the modern history of cross-cultural research, then systematically reviews major empirical studies published since 2010, and next analyzes extant approaches to interpret how the constructs of belief, morality, and values have been theorized and operationalized. The analysis reveals that the field of cross-cultural studies remains dominated by Western approaches, especially studies developed and deployed from the United States and Western Europe. While numerous surveys have been translated and employed for data collection in countries beyond the U.S. and Western Europe, several countries remain under-studied, and the field lacks approaches that were developed within the countries of interest. The paper concludes by outlining future directions for the study of cross-cultural research. To progress from the colonialist past embedded within cross-cultural research, in which scholars from the U.S. and Western Europe export research tools to other world regions, the field needs to expand to include studies locally developed and deployed within more countries and world regions.},

Do they regard them as factual and objective, or as more subjective and opinion-based, and what might predict such differences? In three experiments, we set out a methodology for assessing the perceived objectivity of ethical beliefs, and use it to document several novel findings. Experiment 1 showed that individuals tend to regard ethical statements as clearly more objective than social conventions and tastes, and almost as objective as scientific facts. Yet, there was considerable variation in objectivism, both across different ethical statements, and across individuals. The extent to which individuals treat ethical beliefs as objective was predicted by the way they grounded their ethical systems. Groundings which emphasize the religious, pragmatic, and self-identity underpinnings of ethical belief each independently predicted greater ethical objectivity. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings with a refined measure of ethical objectivism. Experiment 3 demonstrated the robustness of the religious grounding of ethics, and differentiates it from mere religious belief and from political orientation. The results shed light on the nature of ethical belief, and have implications for the resolution of ethical disputes.},

  abstract = {Systematic review, meta-analysis and other forms of evidence synthesis are critical to strengthen the evidence base concerning conservation issues and to answer ecological and evolutionary questions. Synthesis lags behind the pace of scientific publishing, however, due to time and resource costs which partial automation of evidence synthesis tasks could reduce. Additionally, current methods of retrieving evidence for synthesis are susceptible to bias towards studies with which researchers are familiar. In fields that lack standardized terminology encoded in an ontology, including ecology and evolution, research teams can unintentionally exclude articles from the review by omitting synonymous phrases in their search terms. To combat these problems, we developed a quick, objective, reproducible method for generating search strategies that uses text mining and keyword co-occurrence networks to identify the most important terms for a review. The method reduces bias in search strategy development because it does not rely on a predetermined set of articles and can improve search recall by identifying synonymous terms that research teams might otherwise omit. When tested against the search strategies used in published environmental systematic reviews, our method performs as well as the published searches and retrieves gold-standard hits that replicated versions of the original searches do not. Because the method is quasi-automated, the amount of time required to develop a search strategy, conduct searches, and assemble results is reduced from approximately 17\textendash 34 hr to under 2 hr. To facilitate use of the method for environmental evidence synthesis, we implemented the method in the R package litsearchr, which also contains a suite of functions to improve efficiency of systematic reviews by automatically deduplicating and assembling results from separate databases.},

With increased abstraction and interpretation comes an increased challenge to demonstrate the credibility and authenticity of the analysis. A key issue is to show the logic in how categories and themes are abstracted, interpreted, and connected to the aim and to each other.

In this paper we report on the design and anticipated use of a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping (FCM) called 'Mental Modeler' which makes the mental models of stakeholders explicit and provides an opportunity to incorporate different types of knowledge into environmental decision-making, define hypotheses to be tested, and run scenarios to determine perceived outcomes of proposed policies.},

In parallel, recent deliberative research seeks to more fully address the complex value tradeoffs linked to novel technologies and difficult ethical questions that characterize leading climate mitigation alternatives. New methods such as decision pathway surveys may offer important insights for policy makers by capturing much of the depth and reasoning of small-group deliberations while meeting standard survey goals including large-sample stakeholder engagement. Pathway surveys also can help participants to deepen their factual knowledge base and arrive at a more complete understanding of their own values as they apply to proposed policy alternatives. The pathway results indicate more fully the conditional and context-specific nature of support for several ``upstream'' climate interventions, including solar radiation management techniques and carbon dioxide removal technologies.},

These agents, however, are considerably different from digital or social media: They are designed and perceived as life-like communication partners (i.e., as ``communicative subjects''), which in turn poses distinct challenges for their empirical study. Hence, in this paper, we document, discuss, and evaluate potentials and pitfalls that typically arise for communication scholars when investigating simulated or non-simulated interactions between humans and chatbots, voice assistants, or social robots. In this paper, we focus on experiments (including pre-recorded stimuli, vignettes and the ``Wizard of Oz''-technique) and field studies. Overall, this paper aims to provide guidance and support for communication scholars who want to empirically study human-machine communication. To this end, we not only compile potential challenges, but also recommend specific strategies and approaches. In addition, our reflections on current methodological challenges serve as a~starting point for discussions in communication science on how meaning-making between humans and machines can be investigated in the best way possible, as illustrated in the concluding section.},

  abstract = {Global plastics production has reached 380 million metric tons in 2015, with around 40\% used for packaging. Plastic packaging is diverse and made of multiple polymers and numerous additives, along with other components, such as adhesives or coatings. Further, packaging can contain residues from substances used during manufacturing, such as solvents, along with non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), such as impurities, oligomers, or degradation products. To characterize risks from chemicals potentially released during manufacturing, use, disposal, and/or recycling of packaging, comprehensive information on all chemicals involved is needed. Here, we present a database of Chemicals associated with Plastic Packaging (CPPdb), which includes chemicals used during manufacturing and/or present in final packaging articles. The CPPdb lists 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging and 3377 substances that are possibly associated. Of the 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging, 63 rank highest for human health hazards and 68 for environmental hazards according to the harmonized hazard classifications assigned by the European Chemicals Agency within the Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP) regulation implementing the United Nations' Globally Harmonized System (GHS). Further, 7 of the 906 substances are classified in the European Union as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT), or very persistent, very bioaccumulative (vPvB), and 15 as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Thirty-four of the 906 chemicals are also recognized as EDC or potential EDC in the recent EDC report by the United Nations Environment Programme. The identified hazardous chemicals are used in plastics as monomers, intermediates, solvents, surfactants, plasticizers, stabilizers, biocides, flame retardants, accelerators, and colorants, among other functions. Our work was challenged by a lack of transparency and incompleteness of publicly available information on both the use and toxicity of numerous substances. The most hazardous chemicals identified here should be assessed in detail as potential candidates for substitution.},

Often part of the research question is the identification of the most important regressors or an importance ranking of the regressors. Most regression models are not specifically suited for answering the variable importance question, so that many different proposals have been made. This article reviews in detail the various variable importance metrics for the linear model, particularly emphasizing variance decomposition metrics. All linear model metrics are illustrated by an example analysis. For nonlinear parametric models, several principles from linear models have been adapted, and machine-learning methods have their own set of variable importance methods. These are also briefly covered. Although there are many variable importance metrics, there is still no convincing theoretical basis for them, and they all have a heuristic touch. Nevertheless, some metrics are considered useful for a crude assessment in the absence of a good subject matter theory.

  abstract = {Mediation is a method for conflict resolution in which an impartial mediator reconciles the conflicting parties by fostering mutual understanding. A Cognitive-Affective Map (CAM) is a novel concept graph that is able to represent cognitions and affects of somebody's point of view. CAMedaid is a portmanteau consisting of the words CAM, (to) mediate and (to) aid. It's meant to express, that CAMs perhaps are a helpful method in mediation. To examine this further, our participants drew a CAM on a controversial topic. A week later, participants who drew a CAM of positive affective connotation at the first measurement time point elaborated a negative CAM and vice versa. After this, the participants drew a second CAM. A control group elaborated their first CAM. In addition, a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM3) was used to validate our findings. Our first hypothesis could be accepted: The pre-post difference concerning the CAM's average valence was greater in the experimental group than in the control group. Our second hypothesis could be accepted as well: The pre-post difference concerning the TAM3's aggregated score was greater in the experimental group than in the control group. This means, that the elaboration of a CAM of opposite affective connotation was able to change the point of view of the participants in our experimental group. The TAM3 questionnaire provided a first hint at the validation of CAMs for the purpose of opinion change. All in all, we highly recommend the further examination of CAMs in mediation.},

  abstract = {``Total survey error'' is a conceptual framework describing statistical error properties of sample survey statistics. Early in the history of sample surveys, it arose as a tool to focus on implications of various gaps between the conditions under which probability samples yielded unbiased estimates of finite population parameters and practical situations in implementing survey design. While the framework permits design-based estimates of various error components, many of the design burdens to produce those estimates are large, and in practice most surveys do not implement them. Further, the framework does not incorporate other, nonstatistical, dimensions of quality that are commonly utilized in evaluating statistical information. The importation of new modeling tools brings new promise to measuring total survey error components, but also new challenges. A lasting value of the total survey error framework is at the design stage of a survey, to attempt a balance of costs and various errors. Indeed, this framework is the central organizing structure of the field of survey methodology.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to review research conducted in 2003\textendash 2006 in the EU-15 countries on how consumers perceive, understand, like and use nutrition information on food labels. Based on a search of databases on academic publications, Google-based search, and enquiries directed to a range of food retailers, food companies, consumer associations and government agencies, a total of 58 studies were identified. These studies were summarised using a standard format guided by a model of consumer information processing, and these summaries were subsequently processed using the MAXqda software in order to identify key findings and common themes across the studies. The studies show widespread consumer interest in nutrition information on food packages, though this interest varies across situations and products. Consumers like the idea of simplified front of pack information but differ in their liking for the various formats. Differences can be related to conflicting preferences for ease of use, being fully informed and not being pressurised into behaving in a particular way. Most consumers understand the most common signposting formats in the sense that they themselves believe that they understand them and they can replay key information presented to them in an experimental situation. There is, however, virtually no insight into how labelling information is, or will be, used in a real-world shopping situation, and how it will affect consumers' dietary patterns. Results are largely in line with an earlier review by Cowburn and Stockley (Public Health Nutr 8:21\textendash 28, 2005), covering research up to 2002, but provide new insights into consumer liking and understanding of simplified front of pack signposting formats. There is an urgent need for more research studying consumer use of nutritional information on food labels in a real-world setting.},

It identifies the societal meaning attached to new technology as the core object of TA reasoning. This view brings the processes of generating, disseminating, and contesting the meaning assigned within the focus of TA. These processes will be modeled as hermeneutic circles with inputs and outputs, where competing offers of meaning enter the field, motivating modifications and enabling reflexive learning. This allows complementing the consequentialist approach of TA with hermeneutic investigation and reflection, as well as drawing several conclusions for TA, e.g. with respect to role concepts and the Control Dilemma.},

  abstract = {Handling the impacts and consequences of technology has become a problem of political, social and scientific relevance since the Sixties. The earlier assumption that technological evolution would automatically lead to social and human progress in an emphatic sense can no longer be sustained. The ambivalence of technology has become a standing topic in the public, philosophical and scientific debate .In this situation new challenges to technology policy are emerging. Functions of an `early warning' with respect to the risks or potentials of new technologies or to ways of avoiding or, at least, resolving technology conflicts by compromise have been postulated . Technology policy pursued by parliament or government, therefore, is in need of scientific consultation . Since the Seventies a number of institutions in this field have been founded , either primarily as parliamentary bureaus of knowledge-transfer to the decision-makers , as networks with a low degree of institutionalization or as independent scientific institutes .The scientific discussion on how to acquire and establish orientational knowledge for decision-makers facing the ambivalence of technology is sectoralized into two branches: the ethics of technology and technology assessment . These two branches are based on fundamentally different assumptions concerning how to give orientation to technology policy: the philosophical ethics, of course, emphasizes the normative implications of decisions on technology and the importance of moral conflicts , while technology assessment relies mainly on sociological or economic research .Both approaches have largely been developed and practised without regard to one another. In Germany, at the beginning of the Nineties the conceptual discussion around these questions was initiated. At first, a lot of misunderstandings appeared, both parties fundamentally criticizing each other, often one denying the competence of the other to deal appropriately with technology problems . In this paper the conflict is analyzed by looking at the situation in Germany, summarizing and weighing the main arguments which have been brought up by TA and the ethical approach to technology.As a result it will be shown that both are partly right, whereby the relative weight of both approaches in their capacity to give orientation is dependent on contextual circumstances. A non-reductionistic overall approach must take into account the normative aspects of the ethics of technology when handling moral conflicts as well as the need for operationalization, concreteness and established knowledge about the processes of ``managing technology in society'' postulated by TA},

Students in an introductory university course completed the vignettes; they answered questions based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), as well as on their ethical approval. Drawing from a sample of N = 361 students, we carried out confirmatory factor analysis. In line with the conceptual basis, eight scenarios can be described. Overall, students do not accept social robots as presenters; however, the assessment of other roles, such as teaching assistant, is positive. By means of a latent profile analysis, we were able to identify four profiles that may be meaningful from a conceptual point of view. One profile is particularly noteworthy. It comprises students who accept social robots not as a means of instruction, e.g., as a tutor, but as a tool, e.g., to promote computational thinking.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Despite the escalating growth of usage of Artificial Intelligence systems (AI) and Artificial Intelligence Agents, it has been found that people still struggle to trust AI. There are many explanations to this phenomenon. In general people still prefer human touch (especially in consumer service), they are not comfortable interacting with AI, they are concerned about data usage and privacy. Last, they believe the system does not have any morality/ethics (Pegasystems Inc., 2019). In fact, despite the spread and improvements of AI agents, those obstacles persist in the adoption and use of personal assistants (Cuadra, Rase; 2018). Trust research in information technology is currently a hot topic: this increased interest might be due to the consequences this technology is bringing. Trust in technology is complex, variegated and many elements can be taken into consideration depending on the context. In technology and computer systems exist the same problems of expectation, of willingness to be vulnerable and of possible negative outcome (Hall, 2010). Trust is a prerequisite of human-human interaction: humans feel the need to have a more predictable environment and understand others' intentions and motivations. In order to interact even in less predictable contexts and circumstances, people apply different strategies, which are found to be similar in Human-Computer-Interaction. Trust plays a fundamental role in technology because it is a ``primary predictor'' for use of technology (Li et al., 2008), increases adoption rates (De Kruijff, 2018) and the acceptance of the computer system (Parasuraman \& Riley, 1997). According to some researchers, trust is about relationship, and as being a social construct, AI lacks intrinsic qualities needed to lead to trust. This current work explores different models and research about psychological trust applied to Human-Agent-Interaction in order to find strategies to build trust in this technology. This was combined with an investigation about users' perceptions and experience with a voice activated assistant and reported trust (in this case Amazon Alexa) in two different interaction modalities. The problem was addressed with a literary review to understand the different approaches of ``Trust research'' and ``AI Agent factors that contributes to trust'', which were further analyzed in a research with 12 participants. The aim was to figure out if trust relationship between Human-agent-interaction was depending on personal, environmental (contextual) or related to a specific device factor. The result of the research identifies the projects elements that are useful to build a trustworthy relationship; the thesis also provides a set of guidelines for designing and build trust in a first-time interaction scenario.},

We link these opposing rationales to contrasting underlying visions of a future impacted by climate change. These visions see the future as either more or less threatening, depending upon whether it includes the possible future use of solar geoengineering. Our analysis links these contrasting visions and governance rationales to existing governance proposals in the literature. In doing so, we illustrate why some proposals differ so significantly, while also showing that similar-sounding proposals may emanate from quite distinct rationales and thus advance different ends, depending upon how they are designed in practice.},

Comprising investigations into analogical case studies, research program mapping, communication and early warning, and technology assessment and choice, real-time TA can inform and support natural science and engineering research, and it can provide an explicit mechanism for observing, critiquing, and influencing social values as they become embedded in innovations. After placing real-time TA in the context of scholarship on technology assessment, the paper elaborates on this coordinated set of research tasks, using the example of nano-scale science and engineering (nanotechnology) research. The paper then discusses issues in the implementation of real-time TA and concludes that the adoption of real-time TA can significantly enhance the societal value of research-based innovation.},

  abstract = {Anticipatory governance is ?a broad-based capacity extended through society that can act on a variety of inputs to manage emerging knowledge-based technologies while such management is still possible?. It motivates activities designed to build capacities in foresight, engagement, and integration ? as well as through their production ensemble. These capacities encourage and support the reflection of scientists, engineers, policy makers, and other publics on their roles in new technologies. This article reviews the early history of the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the United States, and it further explicates anticipatory governance through exploring the genealogy of the term and addressing a set of critiques found in the literature. These critiques involve skepticism of three proximities of anticipatory governance: to its object, nanotechnology, which is a relatively indistinct one; to the public, which remains almost utterly na\"ive toward nanotechnology; and to technoscience itself, which allegedly renders anticipatory governance complicit in its hubris. The article concludes that the changing venues and the amplification within them of the still, small voices of folks previously excluded from offering constructive visions of futures afforded by anticipatory governance may not be complete solutions to our woes in governing technology, but they certainly can contribute to bending the long arc of technoscience more toward humane ends.},

  abstract = {Strategies toward ambitious climate targets usually rely on the concept of `decoupling'; that is, they aim at promoting economic growth while reducing the use of natural resources and GHG emissions. GDP growth coinciding with absolute reductions in emissions or resource use is denoted as `absolute decoupling', as opposed to `relative decoupling', where resource use or emissions increase less so than does GDP. Based on the bibliometric mapping in part I (Wiedenhofer et al, 2020 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 063002), we synthesize the evidence emerging from the selected 835 peer-reviewed articles. We evaluate empirical studies of decoupling related to final/useful energy, exergy, use of material resources, as well as CO2 and total GHG emissions. We find that relative decoupling is frequent for material use as well as GHG and CO2 emissions but not for useful exergy, a quality-based measure of energy use. Primary energy can be decoupled from GDP largely to the extent to which the conversion of primary energy to useful exergy is improved. Examples of absolute long-term decoupling are rare, but recently some industrialized countries have decoupled GDP from both production- and, weaklier, consumption-based CO2 emissions. We analyze policies or strategies in the decoupling literature by classifying them into three groups: (1) Green growth, if sufficient reductions of resource use or emissions were deemed possible without altering the growth trajectory. (2) Degrowth, if reductions of resource use or emissions were given priority over GDP growth. (3) Others, e.g. if the role of energy for GDP growth was analyzed without reference to climate change mitigation. We conclude that large rapid absolute reductions of resource use and GHG emissions cannot be achieved through observed decoupling rates, hence decoupling needs to be complemented by sufficiency-oriented strategies and strict enforcement of absolute reduction targets. More research is needed on interdependencies between wellbeing, resources and emissions.},

First, it documents how and why cleavages emerged in this once-unified movement around the time of the 2009 Copenhagen Summit. Second, it shows how an organization's position in the movement's network has a large influence on the tactics it adopts. Finally, it demonstrates how the development of new strategies within this network has influenced the trajectory of global climate politics. The book establishes the ways in which networks are consequential for civil society groups, exploring how these actors can become more effective and suggesting lessons for the future coordination of activism.},

These problems include not only some of the now broadly known environmental issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss, but also related issues such as poverty, security and governance. For all of these problems, progress in nding and implementing solutions has been very slow. The increase in availability of scienti c knowledge has not been re ected in decisive action. It is this mismatch between knowledge and action that lies behind the need for a Handbook of Transdisciplinary Research. As the editors point out in their introduction, a transdisciplinary orientation in research, education and institutions aims to overcome the disconnection between knowledge production, on the one hand, and the demand for knowledge to contribute to the solution of societal pr- lems, on the other hand. This is achieved through transdisciplinary approaches in which researchers from a wide range of disciplines work together with sta- holders. Internationally the term `transdisciplinary research' is de ned in diff- ent ways, ranging from a diffuse conceptual term located above individual dis- plines, to any research that involves stakeholders. The Handbook contributes to a clari cation of both the concept and the term, and shows that the uniqueness of the approach lies in the partnership between members of different disciplines and stakeholders.},

Despite efforts to communicate the outcomes of risk assessments to consumers, public confidence in the management of potential risks has been low. Various reasons behind this have been identified, chiefly a disagreement between technical experts and consumers over the nature of the hazards on which risk assessments should focus, and perceptions of insufficient openness about uncertainties in risk assessment. Whilst previous research has almost exclusively focused on genetically modified foods, the present paper investigates plant varieties developed by means of mutation breeding, a less-debated class of novel foods. Two studies were conducted that investigated the mental models of experts and laypeople. The results revealed that the mental models of both groups differed in terms of scope, depth and the role of uncertainty. Furthermore, a number of misconceptions became apparent in the study of laypeople's mental models, often related to the regulatory system governing risk assessments of novel foods. Critical issue are outlined and communication needs are discussed.},

Despite widespread efforts to communicate the outcomes of risk assessments to consumers, public confidence in risk management has been low. Social scientists have identified various reasons for this, including a disagreement between technical experts and consumers over the nature of the hazards on which risk assessments should focus. The aim of this study was to identify and compare the ways in which experts and consumers understand the benefits and risks associated with a genetically modified example crop. Two qualitative studies were conducted. In Study 1, mental models were elicited from 24 experts by means of a three-wave Delphi procedure. In Study 2, mental models were elicited from 25 consumers by means of in-depth interviews. As expected, the expert mental models were focused on the types of hazards that can realistically be addressed under current regulatory frameworks, whereas the consumers were often more concerned about issues outside the scope of current legislation. Moreover, the experts tended to define risk and benefit in terms of detailed chains of cause-effect relationships between variables for which clear definitions and measurement rules exist. The concepts the consumers used when reasoning about biological processes were very abstract, suggesting that the participants had, at most, a holistic understanding. In line with this, issues of uncertainty played a prominent role for the consumers.},

In addition, climate skepticism expressed by the political elites may spread to the electorate, thus ultimately affecting mitigation actions at the population level. It is crucial to better understand the psychological mechanisms underlying elite influences on public opinion formation and polarization. Here we show how affective processes contribute to these top-down influences using longitudinal data in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Findings revealed a general decrease in climate change beliefs immediately after the presidential election (November 2016). We moreover found an increase in positive emotions and a decrease in negative emotions toward the Republican Party after the election of President Trump. Most importantly, the positive emotional shift towards the Republican Party mediated the decrease in climate change beliefs: Individuals with pronounced increases in positive emotions toward the Republican Party most strongly reduced their belief in climate change after the presidential election. The effect was intensified among Republican partisans, pointing towards a mechanism underlying political polarization. Using data based on a major real-world political event, our findings illustrate how partisans update their beliefs by referring to the positions of relevant political authorities. We moreover demonstrate how emotions drive top-down influences of political leaders on partisans' opinions and beliefs. Finally, our findings reveal how intensified emotions can contribute to the aggravation of the public climate change divide.},

The author gives 4 reasons for considering the hypothesis that moral reasoning does not cause moral judgment; rather, moral reasoning is usually a post hoc construction, generated after a judgment has been reached. The social intuitionist model is presented as an alternative to rationalist models. The model is a social model in that it deemphasizes the private reasoning done by individuals and emphasizes instead the importance of social and cultural influences. The model is an intuitionist model in that it states that moral judgment is generally the result of quick, automatic evaluations (intuitions). The model is more consistent than rationalist models with recent findings in social, cultural, evolutionary, and biological psychology, as well as in anthropology and primatology.

Since these changes are interrelated and can not be investigated without interdisciplinary collaboration between scientific fields, Earth system science (ESS) is required to provide a framework for recognizing anew the Earth system as one composed of its interacting subsystems. The concept of ESS has been partially realized by Earth system models (ESMs). In this paper, we focus on modeling in ESS, review related findings mainly from the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and introduce tasks under discussion for the next phases of the following areas of science: the global nitrogen cycle, ocean acidification, land-use and land-cover change, ESMs of intermediate complexity, climate geoengineering, ocean CO2 uptake, and deposition of bioavailable iron in marine ecosystems. Since responding to global change is a pressing mission in Earth science, modeling will continue to contribute to the cooperative growth of diversifying disciplines and expanding ESS, because modeling connects traditional disciplines through explicit interaction between them.},

The study builds on survey data and spatial data from three urban contexts of Beijing, Gothenburg and Malmo to analyse both individual-level and contextual factors influencing sustainable travel behaviour.

Among the studied travel modes, cycling appears to be a competitive mode when the travel distances are within 5~km. In all three urban contexts, individuals who have greater environmental awareness are more likely to travel by public transport or cycling if the physical conditions facilitate using these modes. Good access to public transport is likely to increase the usage of both cycling and public transport and reduce car use. Favourable conditions for cycling within 2~km and 5~km radius can positively encourage people to use a bicycle as a feeder mode for public transport. Overall, our findings demonstrate that for mobility policies to increase individuals' motility in relation to sustainable travel modes and encourage a travel behaviour shift towards using alternatives to cars, planners need to take more holistic approaches and design policies that deal with the three motility dimensions in an integrated manner and avoid focusing on a single dimension in isolation.},

Emerging concepts of active and intelligent packaging technologies provide numerous innovative solutions for prolonging shelf-life and improving the quality and safety of food products. There are also new approaches to improving the passive characteristics of food packaging, such as mechanical strength, barrier performance, and thermal stability. The development of sustainable or green packaging has the potential to reduce the environmental impacts of food packaging through the use of edible or biodegradable materials, plant extracts, and nanomaterials. Active, intelligent, and green packaging technologies can work synergistically to yield a multipurpose food-packaging system with no negative interactions between components, and this aim can be seen as the ultimate future goal for food packaging technology. This article reviews the principles of food packaging and recent developments in different types of food packaging technologies. Global patents and future research trends are also discussed.},

Yet, according to the 2018 Economics Nobel laureate William Nordhaus, these targets are economically suboptimal or unattainable and the world community should aim for 3.5\,\textdegree C in 2100 instead. Here, we show that the UN climate targets may be optimal even in the Dynamic Integrated Climate\textendash Economy (DICE) integrated assessment model, when appropriately updated. Changes to DICE include more accurate calibration of the carbon cycle and energy balance model, and updated climate damage estimates. To determine economically `optimal' climate policy paths, we use the range of expert views on the ethics of intergenerational welfare. When updates from climate science and economics are considered jointly, we find that around three-quarters (or one-third) of expert views on intergenerational welfare translate into economically optimal climate policy paths that are consistent with the 2\,\textdegree C (or 1.5\,\textdegree C) target.},

Unfortunately, most of these studies were disjunctive, simply adding confusion to an already unfocused area of research. However, Reidenbach and Robin (1988, 1990), have changed this trend by attempting to quantify the various ethical philosophies into a multi-dimensional scale of business ethics. This paper examines the background of the Reidenbach and Robin (1988, 1990) scale \textemdash{} including the authors' findings, empirically tests the scale, and concludes that the scale needs further refinement. A promising result is a model with four dimensions: a broadbased ethical judgment dimension, a deontological judgment dimension, a teleological judgment dimension, and a social contract dimension.},

Doing so assists in grounding big data research in sound theory and practice, as well as in affording effective data retrieval and analysis. (b) Availability of large data sets on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites that provide a psychological window into the attitudes and behaviors of a broad spectrum of the population. (c) Identifying, addressing, and being sensitive to ethical considerations when analyzing large data sets gained from public or private sources. (d) The unavoidable necessity of validating predictive models in big data by applying a model developed on 1 dataset to a separate set of data or hold-out sample. Translational abstracts that summarize the articles in very clear and understandable terms are included in Appendix A, and a glossary of terms relevant to big data research discussed in the articles is presented in Appendix B.

We examine findings in environmental psychology emphasizing that people's (environmental) value-orientation is the dominant driver determining individuals' support for pro-environmental policy instruments. We introduce a complementary model, mainly drawing upon findings in political science, suggesting that people's support for policy instruments is dependent on their level of political trust and their trust in other citizens. More specifically, we analyze whether political trust and inter-personal trust affect individuals' support for an increased carbon dioxide tax in Sweden, while checking their value orientation, self-interest, and various socio-economic values. We make use of survey data obtained from a mail questionnaire sent out to a random sample of 3,000 individuals in 2009. We find that apart from people's values, beliefs, and norms, both political trust and interpersonal trust have significant effects on people's attitudes toward an increased tax on carbon dioxide.},

Aspirational ethics allows the professional more discretion in determining what it involves and when and how it is implemented. While preventive ethics must continue to be an important part of professional ethics in engineering, aspirational ethics should be given a more prominent place. Four types of action falling in the category of aspirational ethics can be distinguished, based on their increasingly direct focus on promoting human well-being. Four virtues can be identified as having special importance in motivating and guiding aspirational ethics.},

This argument is easily discredited, and in fact the opposite\textemdash that we should ``play God''\textemdash may be equally valid in some circumstances. To revive the playing God critique, I argue that it functions not on a logical but on a symbolic and emotional level to highlight nostalgia for functional dualisms in the face of the bewildering problem of climate change. It also raises significant questions about the virtue of those who might engineer the climate. These two concerns point to questions about the proper role of human agency. I use the scholarship of Aldo Leopold and H. Richard Niebuhr to argue for a model of human agency based on contextual awareness and responsive, communal responsibility. I conclude with some implications of this view for decision-makers engaging the topic of climate engineering.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a surge of empirical research investigating mental disorders as complex systems. In this article, we investigate how to best make use of this growing body of empirical research and move the field toward its fundamental aims of explaining, predicting, and controlling psychopathology. We first review the contemporary philosophy of science literature on scientific theories and argue that fully achieving the aims of explanation, prediction, and control requires that we construct formal theories of mental disorders: theories expressed in the language of mathematics or a computational programming language. We then investigate three routes by which one can use empirical findings (i.e., data models) to construct formal theories: (a) using data models themselves as formal theories, (b) using data models to infer formal theories, and (c) comparing empirical data models to theory-implied data models in order to evaluate and refine an existing formal theory. We argue that the third approach is the most promising path forward. We conclude by introducing the abductive formal theory construction (AFTC) framework, informed by both our review of philosophy of science and our methodological investigation. We argue that this approach provides a clear and promising way forward for using empirical research to inform the generation, development, and testing of formal theories both in the domain of psychopathology and in the broader field of psychological science.

  abstract = {How will the global atmosphere and climate be protected? Achieving net-zero CO2 emissions will require carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce current GHG emission rates, and negative emissions technology (NET) to recapture previously emitted greenhouse gases. Delivering NET requires radical cost and regulatory innovation to impact on climate mitigation. Present NET exemplars are few, are at small-scale and not deployable within a decade, with the exception of rock weathering, or direct injection of CO2 into selected ocean water masses. To keep warming less than 2\textdegree C, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) has been modelled but does not yet exist at industrial scale. CCS already exists in many forms and at low cost. However, CCS has no political drivers to enforce its deployment. We make a new analysis of all global CCS projects and model the build rate out to 2050, deducing this is 100 times too slow. Our projection to 2050 captures just 700 Mt CO2\,yr-1, not the minimum 6000 Mt CO2\,yr-1 required to meet the 2\textdegree C target. Hence new policies are needed to incentivize commercial CCS. A first urgent action for all countries is to commercially assess their CO2 storage. A second simple action is to assign a Certificate of CO2 Storage onto producers of fossil carbon, mandating a progressively increasing proportion of CO2 to be stored. No CCS means no 2\textdegree C. This article is part of the theme issue `The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5\textdegree C above pre-industrial levels'.},

Although studies comparing the attentiveness of participants on MTurk versus traditional subject pool samples have provided mixed support for this concern, attention check questions and other methods of ensuring participant attention have become prolific in MTurk studies. Because MTurk is a population that learns, we hypothesized that MTurkers would be more attentive to instructions than are traditional subject pool samples. In three online studies, participants from MTurk and collegiate populations participated in a task that included a measure of attentiveness to instructions (an instructional manipulation check: IMC). In all studies, MTurkers were more attentive to the instructions than were college students, even on novel IMCs (Studies 2 and 3), and MTurkers showed larger effects in response to a minute text manipulation. These results have implications for the sustainable use of MTurk samples for social science research and for the conclusions drawn from research with MTurk and college subject pool samples.},

Traditionally, data are aggregated across participants and analyzed under the assumption of independently and identically distributed observations. Hierarchical Bayesian extensions of MPT models explicitly account for participant heterogeneity by assuming that the individual parameters follow a continuous hierarchical distribution. We provide an accessible introduction to hierarchical MPT modeling and present the user-friendly and comprehensive R package TreeBUGS, which implements the two most important hierarchical MPT approaches for participant heterogeneity\textemdash the beta-MPT approach (Smith \& Batchelder, Journal of Mathematical Psychology 54:167-183, 2010) and the latent-trait MPT approach (Klauer, Psychometrika 75:70-98, 2010). TreeBUGS reads standard MPT model files and obtains Markov-chain Monte Carlo samples that approximate the posterior distribution. The functionality and output are tailored to the specific needs of MPT modelers and provide tests for the homogeneity of items and participants, individual and group parameter estimates, fit statistics, and within- and between-subjects comparisons, as well as goodness-of-fit and summary plots. We also propose and implement novel statistical extensions to include continuous and discrete predictors (as either fixed or random effects) in the latent-trait MPT model.},

For instance, in his recent book, Greene (2013) relies on empirical findings to establish utilitarianism as a superior normative ethical theory. Kantian ethics, and deontological ethics more generally, is a rival view that Greene attacks. At the heart of Greene's argument against deontology is the claim that deontological moral judgments are the product of certain emotions and not of reason. Deontological ethics is a mere rationalization of these emotions. Accordingly Greene maintains that deontology should be abandoned. This paper is a defense of deontological ethical theory. It argues that Greene's argument against deontology needs further support. Greene's empirical evidence is open to alternative interpretations. In particular, it is not clear that Greene's characterization of alarm-like emotions that are relative to culture and personal experience is empirically tenable. Moreover, it is implausible that such emotions produce specifically deontological judgments. A rival sentimentalist view, according to which all moral judgments are determined by emotion, is at least as plausible given the empirical evidence and independently supported by philosophical theory. I therefore call for an improvement of Greene's argument.},

This notion implies that public participation is an indispensable element of TA in the context of policy advice. Against this background, participatory TA (pTA) is defended against recent criticism of procedures of lay participation which states that pTA is lacking impact on S\&T decision making, that pTA instead of opening S\&T policies to new perspectives is used as a means to support mainstream S\&T policy and that in pTA procedure the authentic lay perspective is systematically contorted by dominant expert knowledge.},

We introduce lab.js, a free, open-source experiment builder that makes it easy to build studies for both online and in-laboratory data collection. Through its visual interface, stimuli can be designed and combined into a study without programming, though studies' appearance and behavior can be fully customized using html, css, and JavaScript code if required. Presentation and response times are kept and measured with high accuracy and precision heretofore unmatched in browser-based studies. Experiments constructed with lab.js can be run directly on a local computer and published online with ease, with direct deployment to cloud hosting, export to web servers, and integration with popular data collection platforms. Studies can also be shared in an editable format, archived, re-used and adapted, enabling effortless, transparent replications, and thus facilitating open, cumulative science. The software is provided free of charge under an open-source license; further information, code, and extensive documentation are available from https://lab.js.org/.},

The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior \textendash{} hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity.

For variance-based structural equation modeling, such as partial least squares, the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the examination of cross-loadings are the dominant approaches for evaluating discriminant validity. By means of a simulation study, we show that these approaches do not reliably detect the lack of discriminant validity in common research situations. We therefore propose an alternative approach, based on the multitrait-multimethod matrix, to assess discriminant validity: the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations. We demonstrate its superior performance by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study, in which we compare the new approach to the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the assessment of (partial) cross-loadings.

  abstract = {The transportation sector, led by the automobile, has been cited constantly as a major contributor through human intervention to climate change. Short of banning car use, the challenge remains one of understanding better what mix of actions might contribute in non-marginal ways to reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and the absolute amount of CO2 produced by automobiles. This paper evaluates instruments aimed at a number of policy objectives linked to efficiency, sustainability and equity, focusing on social surplus gains in addition to cost effectiveness; but in particular the ability to reduce CO2. TRESIS, an integrated transport, land use and environmental strategy impact simulation program, is used to assess the influence on CO2 of a number of `at source' and `mitigation' instruments such as improvements in fuel efficiency, a carbon tax, variable user charges, and improvements in public transit. TRESIS is applied to the Sydney metropolitan area with instruments enacted in 2010 up to 2015.},

  abstract = {This article deals with factors influencing the development of technology acceptance using the example of voice control in televisions. The focus lies on three user-specific factors: personality (big five), affinity for technology and risk awareness. The research question is whether the inclusion of these three user-specific factors provides an added value compared to existing models. A representative quantitative online survey was conducted (N=439) to determine user-specific criteria and their individual level of acceptance. By using a hierarchical regression analysis two important results occurred: On the one side, it became apparent that the emergence of acceptance of voice control depends on the level of risk awareness as well as the openness for new experiences and the conscientiousness of the respondents. Whereby, the affinity for technology had no significant influence on acceptance. On the other side, the postulated user-specific factors contribute only marginally (5.2\%) to the explanation of variance of the model, whereas the benefit expectation could explain a significantly higher variance share (54.9\%). This is in line with previous research results and supports the assumption that user-specific factors provide added value in acceptance research, but it is not very large.},

  abstract = {Geoengineering, the ``deliberate, large-scale manipulation of the planetary environment in order to counteract anthropogenic climate change'' (Shepherd et al. 2009, 1), is attracting increasing interest. As well as the Royal Society, various scientific and government organizations have produced reports on the potential and challenge of geoengineering as a potential strategy, alongside mitigation and adaptation, to avoid the vast human and environmental costs that climate change is thought to bring (Blackstock et al. 2009; GAO 2010; Long et al. 2011; Rickels et al. 2011). ``Geoengineering'' covers a diverse range of proposals conventionally divided into carbon dioxide removal (CDR) proposals and solar radiation management (SRM) proposals. This article argues that ``geoengineering'' should not be regarded as a third category of response to climate change, but should be disaggregated. Technically, CDR and SRM are quite different and discussing them together under the rubric of geoengineering can give the impression that all the technologies in the two categories of response always raise similar challenges and political issues when this is not necessarily the case. However, CDR and SRM should not be completely subsumed into the preexisting categories of mitigation and adaptation. Instead, they can be regarded as two parts of a five-part continuum of responses to climate change. To make this case, the first section of this article discusses whether geoengineering is distinctive, and the second situates CDR and SRM in relation to other responses to climate change.},

Green growth theory asserts that continued economic expansion is compatible with our planet's ecology, as technological change and substitution will allow us to absolutely decouple GDP growth from resource use and carbon emissions. This claim is now assumed in national and international policy, including in the Sustainable Development Goals. But empirical evidence on resource use and carbon emissions does not support green growth theory. Examining relevant studies on historical trends and model-based projections, we find that: (1) there is no empirical evidence that absolute decoupling from resource use can be achieved on a global scale against a background of continued economic growth, and (2) absolute decoupling from carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid enough to prevent global warming over 1.5\textdegree C or 2\textdegree C, even under optimistic policy conditions. We conclude that green growth is likely to be a misguided objective, and that policymakers need to look toward alternative strategies.},

The first phase of this project consisted of mapping the prevalence of symbolic and non-symbolic nutrition and health-related claims (NHC) on foods and non-alcoholic beverages in five European countries. Pre-packaged foods and drinks were sampled based on a standardized sampling protocol, using store lists or a store floor plan. Data collection took place across five countries, in three types of stores. A total of 2034 foods and drinks were sampled and packaging information was analyzed. At least one claim was identified for 26\% (95\% CI (24.0\%\textendash 27.9\%)) of all foods and drinks sampled. Six percent of these claims were symbolic. The majority of the claims were nutrition claims (64\%), followed by health claims (29\%) and health-related ingredient claims (6\%). The most common health claims were nutrient and other function claims (47\% of all claims), followed by disease risk reduction claims (5\%). Eight percent of the health claims were children's development and health claims but these were only observed on less than 1\% (0.4\%\textendash 1.1\%) of the foods. The category of foods for specific dietary use had the highest proportion of NHC (70\% of foods carried a claim). The prevalence of symbolic and non-symbolic NHC varies across European countries and between different food categories. This study provides baseline data for policy makers and the food industry to monitor and evaluate the use of claims on food packaging.},

In this article we argue for an interdisciplinary approach to meet this demand for evaluating new and specifically bioinspired technologies. We combine the consideration of normative principles in the field of ethics with psychological-empirical research on attitudes. In doing so, the paper has a twofold concern: first, we discuss how such an interdisciplinary collaboration can be implemented by using the method of Cognitive-Affective Mapping. Cognitive-Affective Maps (CAMs) enable a graphical representation of attitudes, including cognitive and affective aspects. Second, we argue that CAMs can be helpful to remedy the deficits of traditional ethical approaches. We applied CAMs in the context of an ethics seminar in which students were instructed to create CAMs based on bioinspired technologies twice \textendash{} prior to the seminar to assess their evaluation on bioinspired technologies per se (pre-assessment) and after the seminar to assess how their evaluation might have changed and especially which normative ethical principles might have been additionally considered (post-assessment). As could be shown, CAMs can visualize the students' attitudes, including the valence of ethical principles. Further, comparing pre- and post-CAMs indicated students' attitude change.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of software with which to estimate multivariate multilevel models (also called multilevel structural equation models) makes it easier than ever before to leverage these powerful techniques to answer research questions at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously. However, interpretation can be tricky given that different choices for centering model predictors can lead to different versions of what appear to be the same parameters; this is especially the case when the predictors are latent variables created through model-estimated variance components. A further complication is a recent change to Mplus (Version 8.1), a popular software program for estimating multivariate multilevel models, in which the selection of Bayesian estimation instead of maximum likelihood results in different lower-level predictors when random slopes are requested. This article provides a detailed explication of how the parameters of multilevel models differ as a function of the analyst's decisions regarding centering and the form of lower-level predictors (i.e., observed or latent), the method of estimation, and the variant of program syntax used. After explaining how different methods of centering lower-level observed predictor variables result in different higher-level effects within univariate multilevel models, this article uses simulated data to demonstrate how these same concepts apply in specifying multivariate multilevel models with latent lower-level predictor variables. Complete data, input, and output files for all of the example models have been made available online to further aid readers in accurately translating these central tenets of multivariate multilevel modeling into practice.},

Organized by research design and data type, the text uses in-depth examples to provide a complete description of the model-building process. The core longitudinal models and their extensions are presented within a multilevel modeling framework, paying careful attention to the modeling concerns that are unique to longitudinal data. Written in a conversational style, the text provides verbal and visual interpretation of model equations to aid in their translation to empirical research results. Overviews and summaries, boldfaced key terms, and review questions will help readers synthesize the key concepts in each chapter.  Written for non-mathematically-oriented readers, this text features: A description of the data manipulation steps required prior to model estimation so readers can more easily apply the steps to their own data An emphasis on how the terminology, interpretation, and estimation　of familiar general linear models relates to those of more complex models for longitudinal data  Integrated model comparisons, effect sizes, and statistical inference in each example to strengthen readers' understanding of the overall model-building process Sample results sections for each example to provide useful templates for published reports Examples using both real and simulated data in the text, along with syntax and output for SPSS, SAS, STATA, and Mplus　at　www.PilesOfVariance.com　to help readers apply the models　to their own data The book opens with the building blocks of longitudinal analysis\textemdash general ideas, the general linear model for between-person analysis, and between- and within-person models for the variance and the options within repeated measures analysis of variance. Section 2 introduces unconditional longitudinal models including alternative covariance structure models to describe within-person fluctuation over time and random effects models for within-person change. Conditional longitudinal models are presented in section 3, including both time-invariant and time-varying predictors. Section 4 reviews advanced applications, including alternative metrics of time in accelerated longitudinal designs, three-level models for multiple dimensions of within-person time, the analysis of individuals in groups over time, and repeated measures designs not involving time. The book concludes with additional considerations and future directions, including an overview of sample size planning and other model extensions for non-normal outcomes and intensive longitudinal data. Class-tested at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and in intensive summer workshops, this is　an ideal text for graduate-level courses on　longitudinal analysis or general multilevel modeling taught in psychology, human development and family studies, education, business, and other behavioral, social, and health sciences. The book's accessible approach will also help those trying to learn on their own. Only familiarity with general linear models (regression, analysis of variance) is needed for this text.},

Studies have utilized a variety of different automated systems in diverse experimental paradigms to identify factors that impact operators? trust.Method:We performed a systematic review of empirical research on trust in automation from January 2002 to June 2013. Papers were deemed eligible only if they reported the results of a human-subjects experiment in which humans interacted with an automated system in order to achieve a goal. Additionally, a relationship between trust (or a trust-related behavior) and another variable had to be measured. All together, 101 total papers, containing 127 eligible studies, were included in the review.Results:Our analysis revealed three layers of variability in human?automation trust (dispositional trust, situational trust, and learned trust), which we organize into a model. We propose design recommendations for creating trustworthy automation and identify environmental conditions that can affect the strength of the relationship between trust and reliance. Future research directions are also discussed for each layer of trust.Conclusion:Our three-layered trust model provides a new lens for conceptualizing the variability of trust in automation. Its structure can be applied to help guide future research and develop training interventions and design procedures that encourage appropriate trust.},

  abstract = {The adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015 moved the world a step closer to avoiding dangerous climate change. The aggregated individual intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) are not yet sufficient to be consistent with the long-term goals of the agreement of `holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2\textdegree C' and `pursuing efforts' towards 1.5\textdegree C. However, the Paris Agreement gives hope that this inconsistency can be resolved. We find that many of the contributions are conservative and in some cases may be overachieved. We also find that the preparation of the INDCs has advanced national climate policy-making, notably in developing countries. Moreover, provisions in the Paris Agreement require countries to regularly review, update and strengthen these actions. In addition, the significant number of non-state actions launched in recent years is not yet adequately captured in the INDCs. Finally, we discuss decarbonization, which has happened faster in some sectors than expected, giving hope that such a transition can also be accomplished in other sectors. Taken together, there is reason to be optimistic that eventually national action to reduce emissions will be more consistent with the agreed global temperature limits.Policy relevanceThe next step for the global response to climate change is not only implementation, but also strengthening, of the Paris Agreement. To this end, national governments must formulate and implement policies to meet their INDC pledges, and at the same time consider how to raise their level of ambition. For many developing countries, implementation and tougher targets will require financial, technological and other forms of support. The findings of this article are highly relevant for both national governments and support organizations in helping them to set their implementation priorities.

  abstract = {There has been an explosion of interest during the past two decades in a class of nonmarket stated-preference valuation methods known as choice experiments. The overall objective of a choice experiment is to estimate economic values for characteristics (or attributes) of an environmental good that is the subject of policy analysis, where the environmental good or service comprises several characteristics. Including price as a characteristic permits a multidimensional, preference-based valuation surface to be estimated for use in benefit-cost analysis or any other application of nonmarket valuation. The chapter begins with an overview of the historical antecedents contributing to the development of contemporary choice experiments, and then each of the steps required for conducting a choice experiment are described. This is followed by detailed information covering essential topics such as choosing and implementing experimental designs, interpreting standard and more advanced random utility models, and estimating measures of willingness-to-pay. Issues in implementing and interpreting random utility models are illustrated using a choice experiment application to a contemporary environmental problem. Overall, this chapter provides readers with practical guidance on how to design and analyze a choice experiment that provides credible value estimates to support decision-making.},

  abstract = {Although published works rarely include causal estimates from more than a few model specifications, authors usually choose the presented estimates from numerous trial runs readers never see. Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is possible to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

We argue that construing ideologies as conceptual networks of cognitive-affective representations embedded in social networks of people may provide a path for bridging these existing gaps and epistemological disputes. Tools from cognitive science and computational social science such as cognitive-affective mapping, connectionist simulations, and agent-based modeling are appropriate methods for a new research program that substantiates our complex systems perspective on ideology.},

This article contributes to a general framework to navigate the ethics of disruptive technologies. It proposes three basic distinctions to be included in such a framework. First, emerging technologies may instigate localized ``first-order'' disruptions, or systemic ``second-order'' disruptions. The ethical significance of these disruptions differs: first-order disruptions tend to be of modest ethical significance, whereas second-order disruptions are highly significant. Secondly, technologies may be classified as disruptive based on their technological features or based on their societal impact. Depending on which of these classifications one adopts and takes as the starting point of ethical inquiry, different ethical questions are foregrounded. Thirdly, the ethics of disruptive technology raises concerns at four different levels of technology assessment: the technology level, the artifact level, the application level, and the society level. The respective suitability of approaches in technology ethics to address concerns about disruptive technologies co-varies with the respective level of analysis. The article clarifies these distinctions, thereby laying some of the groundwork for an ethical framework tailored for assessing disruptive technologies.},

Does technology have a similarly transformative influence on societies' morality? Scholars have not rigorously investigated the role of technology in moral revolutions, even though existing research on technomoral change suggests that this role may be considerable. In this paper, we explore what the role of technology in moral revolutions, understood as processes of radical group-level moral change, amounts to. We do so by investigating four historical episodes of radical moral change in which technology plays a noteworthy role. Our case-studies illustrate the plurality of mechanisms involved in technomoral revolutions, but also suggest general patterns of technomoral change, such as technology's capacity to stabilize and destabilize moral systems, and to make morally salient phenomena visible or invisible. We find several leads to expand and refine conceptual tools for analysing moral change, specifically by crystallizing the notions of `technomoral niche construction' and `moral payoff mechanisms'. Coming to terms with the role of technology in radical moral change, we argue, enriches our understanding of moral revolutions, and alerts us to the depths of which technology can change our societies in wanted and unwanted ways.},

As a response to this challenge, we report on a meta-analysis of the correlates of belief in climate change. Twenty-seven variables were examined by synthesizing 25 polls and 171 academic studies across 56 nations. Two broad conclusions emerged. First, many intuitively appealing variables (such as education, sex, subjective knowledge, and experience of extreme weather events) were overshadowed in predictive power by values, ideologies, worldviews and political orientation. Second, climate change beliefs have only a small to moderate effect on the extent to which people are willing to act in climate-friendly ways. Implications for converting sceptics to the climate change cause\textemdash and for converting believers' intentions into action\textemdash are discussed.},

Thus, it may be that the ideological nature of climate change beliefs reflects something distinctive about the United States rather than being an international phenomenon. Here we find that positive correlations between climate scepticism and indices of ideology were stronger and more consistent in the United States than in the other 24 nations tested. This suggests that there is a political culture in the United States that offers particularly strong encouragement for citizens to appraise climate science through the lens of their worldviews. Furthermore, the weak relationships between ideology and climate scepticism in the majority of nations suggest that there is little inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science, a finding that has encouraging implications for climate mitigation efforts globally.},

Rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. All three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. The major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. In conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. A summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context. The authors delineate analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of end-of-life care.},

Compared to the usual likelihood method, PL includes a penalty term to control the complexity of the hypothesized model. When the penalty level is appropriately chosen, the PL can yield an SEM model that balances the model goodness-of-fit and model complexity. In addition, the PL results in a sparse estimate that enhances the interpretability of the final model. The proposed method is especially useful when limited substantive knowledge is available for model specifications. The PL method can be also understood as a methodology that links the traditional SEM to the exploratory SEM (Asparouhov \& Muth\'en in Struct Equ Model Multidiscipl J 16:397\textendash 438, 2009). An expectation-conditional maximization algorithm was developed to maximize the PL criterion. The asymptotic properties of the proposed PL were also derived. The performance of PL was evaluated through a numerical experiment, and two real data illustrations were presented to demonstrate its utility in psychological research.},

Using a 2-index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)-based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML-based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true-population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

  abstract = {Environmental and societal problems related to energy use have spurred the development of sustainable energy technologies, such as wind mills, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen vehicles. Public acceptance of these technologies is crucial for their successful introduction into society. Although various studies have investigated technology acceptance, most technology acceptance studies focused on a limited set of factors that can influence public acceptance, and were not based on a comprehensive framework including key factors influencing technology acceptance. This paper puts forward a comprehensive framework of energy technology acceptance, based on a review of psychological theories and on empirical technology acceptance studies. The framework aims to explain the intention to act in favor or against new sustainable energy technologies, which is assumed to be influenced by attitude, social norms, perceived behavioral control, and personal norm. In the framework, attitude is influenced by the perceived costs, risks and benefits, positive and negative feelings in response to the technology, trust, procedural fairness and distributive fairness. Personal norm is influenced by perceived costs, risks and benefits, outcome efficacy and awareness of adverse consequences of not accepting the new technology. The paper concludes with discussing the applicability of the framework.},

We present VADER, a simple rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, and compare its effectiveness to eleven typical state-of-practice benchmarks including LIWC, ANEW, the General Inquirer, SentiWordNet, and machine learning oriented techniques relying on Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.},

Multiplex networks are ubiquitous since they describe social, financial, engineering, and biological networks as well. Extending our ability to analyze complex networks to multiplex network structures increases greatly the level of information that is possible to extract from big data. For these reasons, characterizing the centrality of nodes in multiplex networks and finding new ways to solve challenging inference problems defined on multiplex networks are fundamental questions of network science. In this paper, we discuss the relevance of the Multiplex PageRank algorithm for measuring the centrality of nodes in multilayer networks and we characterize the utility of the recently introduced indicator function  \texttildelow{} {$\Theta$} S for describing their mesoscale organization and community structure. As working examples for studying these measures, we consider three multiplex network datasets coming for social science.},

Here, using the high-resolution forecast-oriented low ocean resolution (HiFLOR) model\textemdash which resolves tropical cyclones and has an improved representation of present-day precipitation extremes11,12\textemdash alongside 12 models from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), we analyse the fraction of locations that see their local climate change exacerbated or moderated by SG. Rather than restoring temperatures, we assume that SG is applied to halve the warming produced by doubling CO2 (half-SG). In HiFLOR, half-SG offsets most of the CO2-induced increase of simulated tropical cyclone intensity. Moreover, neither temperature, water availability, extreme temperature nor extreme precipitation are exacerbated under half-SG when averaged over any Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extremes (SREX) region. Indeed, for both extreme precipitation and water availability, less than 0.4\% of the ice-free land surface sees exacerbation. Thus, while concerns about the inequality of solar geoengineering impacts are appropriate, the quantitative extent of inequality may be overstated13.},

This is accomplished through the use of two empirical examples that demonstrate both ridge and lasso approaches across both frequentist and Bayesian estimation, along with detail regarding software implementation. We conclude with a discussion of future research, advocating for increased evaluation and synthesis across both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks.},

However, despite these powerful new analytic approaches, sample sizes may not always be sufficiently large to deal with the increase in model complexity. This difficult modeling scenario entails large models with a limited number of observations given the number of parameters. Here, we describe a particular strategy to overcome this challenge: regularization, a method of penalizing model complexity during estimation. Regularization has proven to be a viable option for estimating parameters in this small-sample, many-predictors setting, but so far it has been used mostly in linear regression models. We show how to integrate regularization within structural equation models, a popular analytic approach in psychology. We first describe the rationale behind regularization in regression contexts and how it can be extended to regularized structural equation modeling. We then evaluate our approach using a simulation study, showing that regularized structural equation modeling outperforms traditional structural equation modeling in situations with a large number of predictors and a small sample size. Next, we illustrate the power of this approach in two empirical examples: modeling the neural determinants of visual short-term memory and identifying demographic correlates of stress, anxiety, and depression.},

With longitudinal data, although a number of statistical frameworks are available for analysis; the use of structural equation modeling has become increasing popular. Hypotheses about change trajectories, determinants of change, along with other components can be formulated as a sequence of models, each representing a specific theoretical formulation. Regularization allows for more flexibility, in both simplifying the model testing process, while promoting the incorporation of more complex specifications. Across both univariate and bivariate LCS models, using both frequentist and Bayesian regularization allowed for a simplified process in choosing a best model, while also increasing the plasticity of the LCS model to incorporate additional parameterizations.},

Ecological Citizenship (EC) has been suggested within the field of political theory as an approach to realize personal responsibility for the environment. However, empirical research on whether EC can serve this purpose is still lacking. Based on a survey sent to 4,000 Swedish households, this paper makes the theory of EC empirically operational and explores whether, and to what extent, people in general hold values and beliefs in line with what is expected of EC, in order to shed light on the feasibility of cultivating ecological citizens in Sweden. The study concludes that a significant proportion of the respondents do demonstrate a value base consistent with EC, i.e., non-territorial altruism and the primacy of social justice. While additional tests and studies are needed, the results support the use of EC as a theoretical model for behavioral change.},

Reliability at a specific level refers to the ratio of true score variance over total variance at that level. This paper aims to shine light on the relation between reliability, cross-level invariance, and strong factorial invariance across clusters in multilevel data.

Contrary to the expectation of rough symmetry in partisan polarization on climate change, we find that partisans on the political right have much more unstable beliefs about climate change than partisans on the left. An important implication is that if climate beliefs are well anchored on the left, but less so on the right, the latter are more susceptible to change. We interpret this to suggest that, despite polarizing elite rhetoric, public beliefs about climate change maintain the potential to shift towards broader acceptance and a perceived need for action.},

While most citrus fruit peels share this basic morphological setup, they differ in various structural and mechanical properties. This study analyzes how various properties in citrus peels of the pomelo, citron, lemon, grapefruit, and orange affect their compression behavior. We compare the structural and biomechanical properties (e.g., density, stress, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) of these peels and analyze which properties they share. Therefore, the peels were quasi-statically compressed to 50\% compression and analyzed with manual and digital image correlation methods. Furthermore, local deformations were visualized, illustrating the inhomogeneous local strain patterns of the peels. The lateral strain of the peels was characterized by strain ratios and the Poisson's ratio, which were close to zero or slightly negative for nearly all tested peels. Our findings prove that\textemdash despite significant differences in stress, magnitude, distribution, and thickness - the tested peels share a low Poisson's ratio meaning that the general peel structures of citrus species offer a promising inspiration for the development of energy dissipating cellular structure that can be used for damage protection.},

We conclude that research on this topic has developed unevenly. Over time, scholars have elaborated on the psychological origins of political misinformation, and this work has cumulated in a productive way. By contrast, although there is an extensive body of research on how to correct misinformation, this literature is less coherent in its recommendations. Finally, a nascent line of research asks whether people's reports of their factual beliefs are genuine or are instead a form of partisan cheerleading.

  abstract = {Keeping global warming below 1.5\textdegree C is technically possible but is it politically feasible? Understanding political feasibility requires answering three questions: (a) ``Feasibility of what?,'' (b) ``Feasibility when and where?,'' and (c) ``Feasibility for whom?.'' In relation to the 1.5\textdegree C target, these questions translate into (a) identifying specific actions comprising the 1.5\textdegree C pathways; (b) assessing the economic and political costs of these actions in different socioeconomic and political contexts; and (c) assessing the economic and institutional capacity of relevant social actors to bear these costs. This view of political feasibility stresses costs and capacities in contrast to the prevailing focus on benefits and motivations which mistakes desirability for feasibility. The evidence on the political feasibility of required climate actions is not systematic, but clearly indicates that the costs of required actions are too high in relation to capacities to bear these costs in relevant contexts. In the future, costs may decline and capacities may increase which would reduce political constraints for at least some solutions. However, this is unlikely to happen in time to avoid a temperature overshoot. Further research should focus on exploring the ``dynamic political feasibility space'' constrained by costs and capacities in order to find more feasible pathways to climate stabilization.

If climate engineering is to be deployed, however, public support is required. The present study hence compared public support for a broad range of climate engineering technologies. Further, the factors that drive public support were investigated and compared across the technologies. In an online survey conducted in Switzerland, respondents (n = 1,575) were randomly allocated to the description of 1 of 10 climate engineering technologies, of which 7 were specific carbon dioxide removal measures and 3 were solar radiation management measures. The results show that the level of public support for afforestation was the highest. The levels of public support for the other climate engineering technologies were relatively similar, although a tendency for solar radiation management to have a lower level of support was identified. Across all the investigated climate engineering technologies, the perceived benefits were an important driver of public support. Additionally, for all the technologies but afforestation, a higher level of trust in industry/science/government increased the level of public support, whereas the factor perceived risks and tampering with nature was found to be a negative predictor of support. The present findings suggest that there are opportunities available for the deployment of several climate engineering technologies in combination with other mitigation measures. Communicating the benefits of such technologies might be an effective strategy in terms of fostering increased support.},

As a response to these challenges, the circular plastic economy is gaining momentum, where the goal is to reduce, reuse and recycle all plastic. The transition to the circular economy should be made across the entire plastics value chain in order to ensure circular design, production, use and waste management. This study examines the current scientific literature in relation to the entire value chain of plastics. This aim of the article is to provide an overview of the existing research (and highlight research gaps) associated with the transition of plastic use to a circular model. The literature was divided into the following categories: 1) design; 2) production; 3) use; 4) end-of-life; and 5) value chain. A high proportion of the literature was found to address the end-of-life phase, suggesting that the other phases are currently neglected. The results have implications that are applicable to multiple phases; in particular, contamination of waste streams and composite materials places significant limitations on the opportunity to recycle and reuse plastic in new products. This calls for changes in the whole value chain, and for trans-sectorial collaboration to ensure systemic transparency. Therefore, future research should take a holistic approach to the transition to circular through careful mapping of implications, stakeholder involvement and collaboration.},

  abstract = {Global net-negative carbon emissions are prevalent in almost all emission pathways that meet the Paris temperature targets. In this paper, we generate and compare cost-effective emission pathways that satisfy two different types of climate targets. First, the common approach of a radiative forcing target that has to be met by the year 2100 (RF2100), and, second, a temperature ceiling target that has to be met over the entire period, avoiding any overshoot. Across two integrated assessment models (IAMs), we found that the amount of net-negative emissions\textemdash when global net emissions fall below zero\textemdash depends to a large extent on how the target is represented, i.e. implemented in the model. With a temperature ceiling (no temperature overshoot), net-negative emissions are limited and primarily a consequence of trade-offs with non-CO2 emissions, whereas net-negative emissions are significant for the RF2100 target (temperature overshoot). The difference becomes more pronounced with more stringent climate targets. This has important implications: more stringent near-term emission reductions are needed when a temperature ceiling is implemented compared to when an RF2100 target is implemented. Further, in one IAM, for our base case assumptions, the cost-effective negative carbon emissions (i.e. gross anthropogenic removals) do not depend to any significant extent on how the constraint is implemented, only, largely, on the ultimate stringency of the constraint. Hence, for a given climate target stringency in 2100, the RF2100 target and the temperature ceiling may result in essentially the same amount of negative carbon emissions. Finally, it is important that IAM demonstrate results for diverse ways of implementing a climate target, since the implementation has implications for the level of near-term emissions and the perceived need for net-negative emissions (beyond 2050).},

  abstract = {Mental Models offers nothing less than a unified theory of the major properties of mind: comprehension, inference, and consciousness. In spirited and graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend the world by building inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events that concern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself be modeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint for building such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do it. In several key areas of cognition, Johnson-Laird shows how an explanation based on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example, he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitly applying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the states of affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguistic comprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rules to propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind's effort to construct and update a model of the situation described by a text or a discourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is Johnson-Laird's theory of consciousness: the mind's necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only a partial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of cognition. This an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recent experimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations of relevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not since Miller, Galanter, and Pribram's classic Plans and the Structure of Behavior has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good sense. Like its distinguished predecessor, Mental Models may well serve to fix a point of view for a generation.},

A key feature of mixed methods research is its methodological pluralism or eclecticism, which frequently results in superior research (compared to monomethod research). Mixed methods research will be successful as more investigators study and help advance its concepts and as they regularly practice it.},

The study involved five classes of fifth-grade students who worked with a partner for a series of heat and convection laboratory investigations. Students' knowledge was assessed before and after instruction through the use of a written test, concept maps, card sort tasks, and interviews. During instruction each dyad was audiorecorded and observed by a field researcher. The patterns and connections among students' conceptual ecologies related to heat and convection as well as the types of schemas that were accessed preceding and subsequent to instruction are described. The types of knowledge elicited by each type of assessment are identified. Findings include the influence of familial and cultural experiences (such as airplanes, weather patterns, and religious beliefs) on conceptual development, as well as the extent to which competing phenomena (evaporation and dissolving) have on the development of new conceptual understandings. The study also found that each assessment measure elicited different types of knowledge. Concept maps were effective in describing students' existing schemas related to heat prior to instruction. Multidimensional scaling and the card sorting task provided information on students' conceptual organization for clusters of concepts. The interviews and dyad discourse transcripts were most effective in revealing the processes and prior knowledge that students used as they interpreted new observations in light of preexisting experiences. \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

This second edition continues to introduce scientific programming and stochastic modelling in a clear, practical, and thorough way. Readers learn programming by experimenting with the provided R code and data.  The book's four parts teach:   Core knowledge of R and programming concepts How to think about mathematics from a numerical point of view, including the application of these concepts to root finding, numerical integration, and optimisation Essentials of probability, random variables, and expectation required to understand simulation Stochastic modelling and simulation, including random number generation and Monte Carlo integration    In a new chapter on systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the authors cover the Euler, midpoint, and fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) schemes for solving systems of first-order ODEs. They compare the numerical efficiency of the different schemes experimentally and show how to improve the RK4 scheme by using an adaptive step size.   Another new chapter focuses on both discrete- and continuous-time Markov chains. It describes transition and rate matrices, classification of states, limiting behaviour, Kolmogorov forward and backward equations, finite absorbing chains, and expected hitting times. It also presents methods for simulating discrete- and continuous-time chains as well as techniques for defining the state space, including lumping states and supplementary variables.  Building readers' statistical intuition, Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R, Second Edition shows how to turn algorithms into code. It is designed for those who want to make tools, not just use them. The code and data are available for download from CRAN.},

It is commonly presumed that soft robots are perceived as more natural, and thus more appealing, than rigid robots, an assumption that has not hitherto been tested or validated. This study investigates human perception of and physical interaction with soft robots as compared with rigid robots. Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted an observational study to explore whether soft robots are perceived as more natural, and what types of interactions soft robots encourage. In a between-subjects study, participants interacted with a soft robotic tentacle or a rigid robot of a similar shape. The interactions were video recorded, and data was also obtained from questionnaires (Nvideo\,=\,123, Nquest\,=\,94). Despite their drastically different appearances and materials, we found no significant differences in how appealing or natural the robots were rated to be. Appeal was positively associated with perceived naturalness in all cases, however we observed a wide variation in how participants define ``natural''. Although participants showed no clear preference, qualitative analysis of video data indicated that soft robots and rigid robots elicit different interaction patterns and behaviors. The findings highlight the key role of physical embodiment and materiality in human\textendash robot interaction, and challenge existing assumptions about what makes robots appear natural.},

The basic premise of cultural theory is that individuals can be expected to form beliefs about societal dangers that reflect and reinforce their commitments to one or another idealized form of social ordering. Among the features of cultural cognition that make it distinctive among conceptions of cultural theory are its approach to measuring individuals' cultural worldviews; its empirical investigation of the social psychological mechanisms that connect individuals' risk perceptions to their cultural worldviews; and its practical goal of enabling self-conscious management of popular risk perceptions in the interest of promoting scientifically sound public policies that are congenial to persons of diverse outlooks.},

  abstract = {This paper examines a remedy for a defect in existing accounts of public risk perceptions. The accounts in question feature two dynamics: the affect heuristic, which emphasizes the impact of visceral feelings on information processing; and the cultural cognition thesis, which describes the tendency of individuals to form beliefs that reflect and reinforce their group commitments. The defect is the failure of these two dynamics, when combined, to explain the peculiar selectivity of public risk controversies: despite their intensity and disruptiveness, such controversies occur less frequently than the affect heuristic and the cultural cognition thesis seem to predict. To account for this aspect of public risk perceptions, the paper describes a model that adds the phenomenon of culturally antagonistic memes \textendash{} argumentative tropes that fuse positions on risk with contested visions of the best life. Arising adventitiously, antagonistic memes transform affect and cultural cognition from consensus-generating, truth-convergent influences on information processing into conflictual, identity-protective ones. The paper supports this model with experimental results involving perceptions of the risk of the Zika virus: a general sample of US subjects, whose cultural orientations were measured with the Cultural Cognition Worldview Scales, formed polarized affective reactions when exposed to information that was pervaded with antagonistic memes linking Zika to global warming; when exposed to comparable information linking Zika to unlawful immigration, the opposing affective stances of the subjects flipped in direction. Normative and prescriptive implications of these results are discussed.},

This article proposes a new explanation: identity-protective cognition. Putting work on the cultural theory of risk together with work on motivated cognition in social psychology suggests that individuals selectively credit and dismiss asserted dangers in a manner supportive of their cultural identities. This dynamic, it is hypothesized, drives the white-male effect, which reflects the risk skepticism that hierarchical and individualistic white males display when activities integral to their cultural identities are challenged as harmful. The article presents the results of an 1,800-person study that confirmed that cultural worldviews interact with the impact of gender and race on risk perception in patterns that suggest cultural-identity-protective cognition.

The Campbell Paradigm is based on a highly restricted measurement model that speaks of a compensatory relation between a person's latent attitude and the costs that come with any specific behavior. It overcomes the overarching weakness of the original tripartite model (i.e., its relative irrelevance for actual behavior) and offers a parsimonious explanation for behavior. Even though this seems attractive, we also discuss why the paradigm has not gained momentum in the 50~years since it was originally proposed by Donald T. Campbell. To demonstrate the paradigm's suitability even when implemented with an unrefined instrument in a domain where it has not been used previously, we apply the paradigm to a classic data example from attitude research from the 1984 US presidential election to account for the electorate's voting intentions and actual voting behaviors.},

Such a measure was developed in a survey study of 445 members of 2 Swiss transportation associations. Three types of ecological behavior measures were included: a general measure, 3 multiple-item measures, and 3 single-item measures. Results are controlled for social desirability effects. Reliability, internal consistency, and validity scores indicate that a probabilistic measurement approach can measure general ecological behavior accurately and unidimensionally.},

  abstract = {Modular construction has been recognized as one of the primary methods for sustainable off-site construction in the recent past. However, in a given building project, the process of selecting a suitable construction method among different options is still made based on anecdotal evidence. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the life cycle sustainability of different construction methods. The sustainability evaluation criteria (SEC) comprise the triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability categories, i.e., environmental, economic, and social, in which each category includes numerous sustainability performance indicators (SPI) associated with different life cycle phases of a building. The most significant step for comparative assessment of the life cycle sustainability of buildings is to develop suitable SPIs. In this paper, a methodology is used to identify and select the appropriate SPIs for life cycle sustainability evaluation of modular and conventional construction. Through a comprehensive literature review, 33 TBL SPIs were identified to address the life cycle sustainability performance of buildings. In order to investigate the applicability (importance) of the identified sustainability indicators when comparing the sustainability of modular and conventional buildings, a survey was designed and conducted. Subsequently, the construction professionals' perceptions of the applicability of these sustainability indicators were captured on a 5-point Likert scale. The reliability of questionnaire was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha measure. Then, all the SPIs were ranked based on their severity index (SI) values ranging between 20 and 100\% correspond to a severity scale from ``very low'' to ``extremely high'' importance levels. All the SPIs were ranked under the overall TBL SPIs as well as within their associated sustainability categories. The analyses showed that 33\% of the environmental SPIs, 67\% of the economic SPIs, and 42\% of the social SPIs were rated equal to or greater than ``high'' on severity scale (i.e., Severity Index {$\geq$}75\%). The economic dimension of sustainability is still the governing concern of the construction industry practitioners. Moreover, the results revealed that attention to the social dimension of sustainability is increasing compared to the environmental dimension. This paper contributes to the current body of knowledge by highlighting the most applicable indicators for comparing and contrasting the sustainability of modular and conventional construction.},

Multiple theoretical frameworks suggest the potential to direct this process of mutual shaping toward desired outcomes and away from undesired ones through broader inclusion of new voices and visions. In 2010, a group of researchers, educators, and policy practitioners established the Expert and Citizen Assessment of Science and Technology (ECAST) network to operationalize these frameworks. Over the course of a decade, ECAST developed an innovative and reflexive participatory technology assessment (pTA) method to support democratic science policy decision-making in different technical, social, and political contexts. The method's reflexive nature gave rise to continuous innovations and iterative improvements. The current ECAST pTA method includes three participatory phases: 1) Problem Framing; 2) ECAST Citizen Deliberation; and 3) Results and Integration. Proving adaptable and replicable, the method has generated outputs for decision-making on a variety of science and technology issues and at governance scales ranging from the local to the national and international. ECAST's distributed network model has also promoted independence, continuity, and sustainability through changing sociopolitical contexts. In this paper, we detail the current state of the ECAST pTA method; share mini case studies to illustrate circumstances that prompted new method innovations; and offer a vision for further developing and integrating pTA into democratic science policy decision-making.},

  abstract = {This book examines test validity in the behavioral, social, and educational sciences by exploring three fundamental problems: measurement, causation and meaning. Psychometric and philosophical perspectives receive attention along with unresolved issues. The authors explore how measurement is conceived from both the classical and modern perspectives. The importance of understanding the underlying concepts as well as the practical challenges of test construction and use receive emphasis throughout. The book summarizes the current state of the test validity theory field. Necessary background on test theory and statistics is presented as a conceptual overview where needed. Each chapter begins with an overview of key material reviewed in previous chapters, concludes with a list of suggested readings, and features boxes with examples that connect theory to practice. These examples reflect actual situations that occurred in psychology, education, and other disciplines in the US and around the globe, bringing theory to life. Critical thinking questions related to the boxed material engage and challenge readers. A few examples include: What is the difference between intelligence and IQ? Can people disagree on issues of value but agree on issues of test validity? Is it possible to ask the same question in two different languages? The first part of the book contrasts theories of measurement as applied to the validity of behavioral science measures.The next part considers causal theories of measurement in relation to alternatives such as behavior domain sampling, and then unpacks the causal approach in terms of alternative theories of causation.The final section explores the meaning and interpretation of test scores as it applies to test validity. Each set of chapters opens with a review of the key theories and literature and concludes with a review of related open questions in test validity theory. Researchers, practitioners and policy makers interested in test validity or developing tests appreciate the book's cutting edge review of test validity. The book also serves as a supplement in graduate or advanced undergraduate courses on test validity, psychometrics, testing or measurement taught in psychology, education, sociology, social work, political science, business, criminal justice and other fields.

  abstract = {The realization that mitigation efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions have, until now, been relatively ineffective has led to an increasing interest in climate engineering as a possible means of preventing the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change. While many studies have addressed the potential effectiveness of individual methods there have been few attempts to compare them. Here we use an Earth system model to compare the effectiveness and side effects of afforestation, artificial ocean upwelling, ocean iron fertilization, ocean alkalinization and solar radiation management during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario. We find that even when applied continuously and at scales as large as currently deemed possible, all methods are, individually, either relatively ineffective with limited ({$<$}8\%) warming reductions, or they have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change. Our simulations suggest that the potential for these types of climate engineering to make up for failed mitigation may be very limited.},

  abstract = {Consumers play an important role in the market penetration of environmentally-friendly food packaging because it is they who decide whether or not to buy a particular product. The objective of this paper is to analyse the state of the art regarding consumers' response to environmentally-friendly food packaging in order to identify existing barriers to purchase and potential measures to overcome these barriers. The paper is based on a systematic synthesis of 46 scientific journal articles on consumer studies related to environmentally-friendly packaging. The literature review applies a conceptual framework regarding the ways consumers respond to product stimuli and the psychological processes involved. Three important barriers to purchasing environmentally-friendly packaging are identified. First, consumers need guidance in recognizing environmentally-friendly packaging; for while consumers primarily consider the packaging material itself and any eco-labels, they also consider other packaging design elements such as colours and pictures of `nature' that can be misleading. Second, it became obvious that consumers lack knowledge, in particular about new packaging materials like bio-based packaging. Third, many of the studies reviewed provide evidence that other product attributes such as price and product quality are more important to consumers than environmentally-friendly packaging. Nevertheless, some studies recorded a significantly higher willingness on the part of consumers to buy and pay for environmentally-friendly packaging and products with reduced packaging compared to products with standard packaging, signalling an overall positive attitude. The literature review revealed many research gaps. For example, it became obvious that consumers' response to environmentally-friendly food packaging is not yet well understood, in particular with regards to purchasing behaviour (in the real world as opposed to in a survey setting) and measures for overcoming existing barriers.},

  abstract = {1.5\,\,\textdegree C scenarios reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) rely on combinations of controversial negative emissions and unprecedented technological change, while assuming continued growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Thus far, the integrated assessment modelling community and the IPCC have neglected to consider degrowth scenarios, where economic output declines due to stringent climate mitigation. Hence, their potential to avoid reliance on negative emissions and speculative rates of technological change remains unexplored. As a first step to address this gap, this paper compares 1.5\,\,\textdegree C degrowth scenarios with IPCC archetype scenarios, using a simplified quantitative representation of the fuel-energy-emissions nexus. Here we find that the degrowth scenarios minimize many key risks for feasibility and sustainability compared to technology-driven pathways, such as the reliance on high energy-GDP decoupling, large-scale carbon dioxide removal and large-scale and high-speed renewable energy transformation. However, substantial challenges remain regarding political feasibility. Nevertheless, degrowth pathways should be thoroughly considered.},

Often, detection of groups with distinct sets of parameters in structural equation models (SEM) are of key importance for applied researchers, for example, when investigating differential item functioning for a mental ability test or examining children with exceptional educational trajectories. In the present article, we present a new approach combining subgroup discovery\textemdash a well-established toolkit of supervised learning algorithms and techniques from the field of computer science\textemdash with structural equation models termed SubgroupSEM. We provide an overview and comparison of three approaches to modeling and detecting heterogeneous groups in structural equation models, namely, finite mixture models, SEM trees, and SubgroupSEM. We provide a step-by-step guide to applying subgroup discovery techniques for structural equation models, followed by a detailed and illustrated presentation of pruning strategies and four subgroup discovery algorithms. Finally, the SubgroupSEM approach will be illustrated on two real data examples, examining measurement invariance of a mental ability test and investigating interesting subgroups for the mediated relationship between predictors of educational outcomes and the trajectories of math competencies in 5th grade children. The illustrative examples are accompanied by examples of the R package subgroupsem, which is a viable implementation of our approach for applied researchers.

In the present article, the authors investigate whether expertise improves perceptual processing to an extent that allows complex visual stimuli to bias behavior unconsciously. Expert chess players judged whether a target chess configuration entailed a checking configuration. These displays were preceded by masked prime configurations that either represented a checking or a nonchecking configuration. Chess experts, but not novice chess players, revealed a subliminal response priming effect, that is, faster responding when prime and target displays were congruent (both checking or both nonchecking) rather than incongruent. Priming generalized to displays that were not used as targets, ruling out simple repetition priming effects. Thus, chess experts were able to judge unconsciously presented chess configurations as checking or nonchecking. A 2nd experiment demonstrated that experts' priming does not occur for simpler but uncommon chess configurations. The authors conclude that long-term practice prompts the acquisition of visual memories of chess configurations with integrated form-location conjunctions. These perceptual chunks enable complex visual processing outside of conscious awareness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Safety and acceptability are critical issues when people are interacting with robots in healthcare. Traditional robot arms are hard and inflexible, and may cause harm to users on impact. Soft robotic arms may be safer and more acceptable in these situations. Similarly robot fingers made of soft materials may be more acceptable and safer than fingers made of hard materials. Robot designers need to know how best to design arms for healthcare scenarios. There is limited research on the acceptability of soft robotic arms and fingers to date. This study aimed to investigate people's reactions to the touch of soft robotic arms and fingers, compared to more traditional hard forms, and to human arms and fingers. A second aim was to investigate people's perceptions of the usefulness of the arms and fingers for healthcare tasks. Thirty five community participants were blindfolded and participated in touching tasks for: 3 arms (soft robot, hard robot, and human) and four fingers (soft robot, medium robot, hard robot, and human) in a randomised order. The soft arm was rated significantly more human-like but also more fragile and less reliable than the hard arm. Participants perceived the soft arm as good for intimate tasks like washing the body, but the hard arm was perceived as better for weight-bearing tasks. The soft finger was rated significantly more creepy, fragile and unreliable than the other fingers. The medium robot finger was rated the most human-like of the robot fingers and was the favourite robot finger. These findings suggest people perceive soft robots to be more fragile than hard robots and as more appropriate for personal tasks. Overly soft fingers may be too creepy to be acceptable.},

The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

In this meta-analysis, the authors draw from over 30 years of research and multiple literatures to examine individual (``bad apple''), moral issue (``bad case''), and organizational environment (``bad barrel'') antecedents of unethical choice. Findings provide empirical support for several foundational theories and paint a clearer picture of relationships characterized by mixed results. Structural equation modeling revealed the complexity (multidetermined nature) of unethical choice, as well as a need for research that simultaneously examines different sets of antecedents. Moderator analyses unexpectedly uncovered better prediction of unethical behavior than of intention for several variables. This suggests a need to more strongly consider a new ``ethical impulse'' perspective in addition to the traditional ``ethical calculus'' perspective. Results serve as a data-based foundation and guide for future theoretical and empirical development in the domain of behavioral ethics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

This model demonstrates how people's conceptions of the nature of knowledge, the nature of reality, and their concepts of justification change over age/educational levels. Sixty subjects from three age/educational levels (high school, college, and graduate school) were administered the Reflective Judgment Interview. In addition, subjects were tested on four other factors hypothesized to affect reflective judgment scores. Two were competing theoretical constructs: verbal ability (using Terman's Concept Mastery Test) and Piagetian formal operations (chemicals and pendulum tasks); and two were potentially confounding factors: socio-economic status (using Hollingshead's two-factor index) and verbal fluency (number of words spoken during the interview). Highly significant differences (p {$<$} .001) were found on reflective judgment level between the three age/educational groups, and could not be statistically accounted for by scores earned on measures of the other four factors. Whereas verbal ability was found to be closely related to reflective judgment level, the differences between groups on reflective judgment could not be solely attributed to this factor.},

These are problems about which ``reasonable people reasonably disagree.'' These problems cannot be solved by the mechanical application of an algorithm; they require making judgments based on the strength of available evidence and the adequacy of argument. For example, citizens are asked to vote on ballot issues such as whether the benefits of spraying for mosquitoes outweighs the health risks, whether a proposed urban growth policy will protect farm land while spurring economic development, and the degree to which a culture of violence and availability of guns contributes to tragedies such as school shootings by teenage boys.

Participants assess researchers and a citizens' jury to be more credible than politicians. Credibility has a strong positive effect on SAI acceptance in both pro-SAI and contra-SAI conditions. Reading the statement against SAI-deployment led to significantly lower acceptance scores compared to reading the pro-statement. However, the difference between messages was unexpectedly small, indicating that the message content was not fully adopted while underlying traits and attitudes mainly shaped acceptance even despite, or because of, low levels of knowledge.},

An online questionnaire utilizing the Self-Assessment Manikin scale was used to evaluate pleasure, arousal, and dominance. Our findings show that a slow breathing rate between 7-12.5 breaths per minute corresponds to a high level of pleasure, whereas a high breathing rate of 40 breaths per minute corresponds to a high level of arousal. Participants' gender, in addition, influences the perception of pleasure and arousal at different breathing rates.

These technologies are considered to be potential substitutes for mitigation strategies in combating climate change. The ongoing process of layperson acceptance and resultant opinion formation can be expected to play a crucial role in future public debate about field experiments or the actual deployment of climate engineering. In July 2017, we assessed public reactions from the German population in a representative online survey. Participants were given a brief text informing them about climate change and one of four different scenarios in a between-subject design (N = 678). Two of the scenarios described the use of climate engineering technologies - stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) and bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) - one of them covered conventional mitigation strategies and the fourth group was given an outline of the business-as-usual (BAU) approach. The mitigation scenario (willingness for individual behaviour changes) showed the highest acceptance rate (M = 74.23), which was significantly higher than acceptance of the other scenarios (p {$<$} .001). Acceptance of BECCS (M = 53.15) was higher than acceptance of SAI (M = 46.25, p = .043) and BAU (M = 42.94; p = .006). We undertook a relative-importance analysis to investigate the influence of multiple predictor variables on acceptance formation for each scenario; the variance thus explained ranged from 80.3\% to 86.8\%. The results point up the influence of perceived risks, subjective norms and affective responses on the acceptance of climate engineering technologies. By contrast, person-specific and relatively stable variables, such as environmental attitudes and wishful thinking, are particularly relevant in the evaluation of the mitigation scenario.},

The candidate research topics, in the form of keyphrases and n-grammes, are subsequently ranked and filtered by a graph-text ranking algorithm. This selection of the highest ranked potential topics is further evaluated by domain experts and through the Wikipedia knowledge base. The results obtained from these citation networks are complementary, returning valid but non-overlapping output phrases between some pairs of networks. In particular, bibliographic coupling appears to capture more unique information than either direct citation or co-citation. These findings point towards the possible added value in combining bibliographic coupling analysis with other structures. At the same time, combining direct citation and co-citation is put into question. We expect our findings to be utilised in method design for research topic identification.},

Whereas Barrett was mostly focusing on the cost of running CE measures, we point out that several determinants of overall economic cost like price or external effects are not yet sufficiently accounted for and that the question of dynamic efficiency is still unresolved. Combining the existing theoretical investigations about the topic from the literature, we show that even though these new measures provide new options to deal with climate change, several of them might also reduce our scope of action. Consequently, we suggest that economic research should shift its focus to portfolios of CE measures and put more emphasis on those measures which control atmospheric carbon concentration and therefore allow extending our scope of action. Additionally, economic research should address the question of phase-in and phase-out scenarios for measures which directly influence the radiation balance.},

Because humans often engage in such multitasking activities, it is important to understand how multitasking affects performance. In the present article, we argue that research on dual-task interference and sequential task switching has proceeded largely separately using different experimental paradigms and methodology. In our article we aim at organizing this complex set of research in terms of three complementary research perspectives on human multitasking. One perspective refers to structural accounts in terms of cognitive bottlenecks (i.e., critical processing stages). A second perspective refers to cognitive flexibility in terms of the underlying cognitive control processes. A third perspective emphasizes cognitive plasticity in terms of the influence of practice on human multitasking abilities. With our review article we aimed at highlighting the value of an integrative position that goes beyond isolated consideration of a single theoretical research perspective and that broadens the focus from single experimental paradigms (dual task and task switching) to favor instead a view that emphasizes the fundamental similarity of the underlying cognitive mechanisms across multitasking paradigms.

Hypotheses are tested with 312 Norwegian consumers who evaluated a beverage container incorporating organic material. Purchase intention was significantly influenced by general environmental concern, but not by rational evaluations of benefits. Rational evaluations had differing effects on positive and negative emotions. Both positive and negative emotions had significant direct effects on purchase intention.

The material in this book is organized to flow from descriptive statistical methods to topics centered on modeling and inference with networks, with the latter separated into two sub-areas, corresponding first to the modeling and inference of networks themselves, and then, to processes on networks. The book begins by covering tools for the manipulation of network data. Next, it addresses visualization and characterization of networks. The book then examines mathematical and statistical network modeling. This is followed by a special case of network modeling wherein the network topology must be inferred. Network processes, both static and dynamic are addressed in the subsequent chapters. The book concludes by featuring chapters on network flows, dynamic networks, and networked experiments. Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R, 2nd Ed. has been written at a level aimed at graduate students and researchers in quantitative disciplines engaged in the statistical analysis of network data, although advanced undergraduates already comfortable with R should find the book fairly accessible as well},

To improve the current minimal understanding of these influences for fresh produce, a survey instrument in the form of an online questionnaire has been developed and launched in the US. The first part of the questionnaire covers consumers' preferences for packaging convenience features, characteristics, materials, disposal method, and others for fresh produces in general, and the second focuses on attributes like price, container size, produce shelf life for a specific fresh produce, sweet cherries, to allow us to supply specific values for these factors to the participants. Cluster and conjoint analyses of responses from 292 participants reveal that specific packaging and produce attributes affect consumer purchase decisions of fresh produce in general and of sweet cherries in particular (P{$\leqslant$}0.05) and that some are population segment dependent (P{$\leqslant$}0.05). For produce packaging in general, `extend the ``best by'' date' was ranked as the top convenience feature, the type of packaging material was considered to affect the food product quality (92.7\%) and containers made from bio-based materials were highly appealing (3.52 out of 5.00).

As societies develop and new technologies arise, new validated scales are needed. Robots and artificial intelligences of various kinds are about to occupy just about every niche in human society. Several tools to measure fears and anxieties about robots do exist, but there is a definite lack of tools to measure hopes and expectations for these new technologies. Here, we create and validate a novel multi-dimensional scale which measures people's attitudes towards robots, giving equal weight to positive and negative attitudes. Our scale differentiates (a) comfort and enjoyment around robots, (b) unease and anxiety around robots, (c) rational hopes about robots in general (at societal level) and (d) rational worries about robots in general (at societal level). The scale was developed by extracting items from previous scales, crowdsourcing new items, testing through 3 scale iterations by exploratory factor analysis (Ns 135, 801 and 609) and validated in its final form of the scale by confirmatory factor analysis (N: 477). We hope our scale will be a useful instrument for social scientists who wish to study human-technology relations with a validated scale in efficient and generalizable ways.},

For this purpose, we perform a sensitivity analysis of four generic emissions reduction measures to identify a lower bound on future CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Final energy demand reductions and electrification of energy end uses as well as decarbonization of electricity and non-electric energy supply are all considered. We find the lower bound of cumulative fossil fuel and industry CO2 emissions to be 570 GtCO2 for the period 2016\textendash 2100, around 250 GtCO2 lower than the lower end of available 1.5\textdegree C mitigation pathways generated with integrated assessment models. Estimates of 1.5\textdegree C-consistent CO2 budgets are highly uncertain and range between 100 and 900 GtCO2 from 2016 onwards. Based on our sensitivity analysis, limiting warming to 1.5\textdegree C will require CDR or terrestrial net carbon uptake if 1.5\textdegree C-consistent budgets are smaller than 650 GtCO2. The earlier CDR is deployed, the more it neutralizes post-2020 emissions rather than producing net negative emissions. Nevertheless, if the 1.5\textdegree C budget is smaller than 550 GtCO2, temporary overshoot of the 1.5\textdegree C limit becomes unavoidable if CDR cannot be ramped up faster than to 4 GtCO2 in 2040 and 10 GtCO2 in 2050.

Students and scholars will learn to treat data not as physical events but as communications that are created and disseminated to be seen, read, interpreted, enacted, and reflected upon according to the meanings they have for their recipients. Interpreting communications as texts in the contexts of their social uses distinguishes content analysis from other empirical methods of inquiry. Organized into three parts, Content Analysis first examines the conceptual aspects of content analysis, then discusses components such as unitizing and sampling, and concludes by showing readers how to trace the analytical paths and apply evaluative techniques. The Fourth Edition has been completely revised to offer you the most current techniques and research on content analysis, including new information on reliability and social media. You will also gain practical advice and experience for teaching academic and commercial researchers how to conduct content analysis.},

Coding is essential to content analysis and social research, including computational linguistics, which concern interpretations of meaningful matter. The usual protocol calls for observers or readers to categorize, scale, or measure each of a given set of predefined units of analysis, in effect characterizing them by one value from each variable of analytical interest. However, there are many occasions in which texts and nonverbal phenomena have multiple interpretations. Until now, there has been no practical way to measure their reliability. This paper proposes a coefficient to measure the reliability of multi-valued data. It adds to Krippendorff's family of alpha coefficients, briefly reviewed. We offer a motivation for using the new coefficient, develop it mathematically, exemplify its computation, explore its behavior, and provide access to open source software to compute its most simple case.},

  abstract = {There is an explosion of interest in Bayesian statistics, primarily because recently created computational methods have finally made Bayesian analysis obtainable to a wide audience.Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan provides an accessible approach to Bayesian data analysis, as material is explained clearly with concrete examples. The book begins with the basics, including essential concepts of probability and random sampling, and gradually progresses to advanced hierarchical modeling methods for realistic data. Included are step-by-step instructions on how to conduct Bayesian data analyses in the popular and free software R and WinBugs. This book is intended for first-year graduate students or advanced undergraduates. It provides a bridge between undergraduate training and modern Bayesian methods for data analysis, which is becoming the accepted research standard. Knowledge of algebra and basic calculus is a prerequisite.New to this Edition (partial list):There are all new programs in JAGS and Stan. The new programs are designed to be much easier to use than the scripts in the first edition. In particular, there are now compact high-level scripts that make it easy to run the programs on your own data sets. This new programming was a major undertaking by itself.The introductory Chapter 2, regarding the basic ideas of how Bayesian inference re-allocates credibility across possibilities, is completely rewritten and greatly expanded.There are completely new chapters on the programming languages R (Ch. 3), JAGS (Ch. 8), and Stan (Ch. 14). The lengthy new chapter on R includes explanations of data files and structures such as lists and data frames, along with several utility functions. (It also has a new poem that I am particularly pleased with.) The new chapter on JAGS includes explanation of the RunJAGS package which executes JAGS on parallel computer cores. The new chapter on Stan provides a novel explanation of the concepts of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The chapter on Stan also explains conceptual differences in program flow between it and JAGS.Chapter 5 on Bayes' rule is greatly revised, with a new emphasis on how Bayes' rule re-allocates credibility across parameter values from prior to posterior. The material on model comparison has been removed from all the early chapters and integrated into a compact presentation in Chapter 10.What were two separate chapters on the Metropolis algorithm and Gibbs sampling have been consolidated into a single chapter on MCMC methods (as Chapter 7). There is extensive new material on MCMC convergence diagnostics in Chapters 7 and 8. There are explanations of autocorrelation and effective sample size. There is also exploration of the stability of the estimates of the HDI limits. New computer programs display the diagnostics, as well.Chapter 9 on hierarchical models includes extensive new and unique material on the crucial concept of shrinkage, along with new examples.All the material on model comparison, which was spread across various chapters in the first edition, in now consolidated into a single focused chapter (Ch. 10) that emphasizes its conceptualization as a case of hierarchical modeling.Chapter 11 on null hypothesis significance testing is extensively revised. It has new material for introducing the concept of sampling distribution. It has new illustrations of sampling distributions for various stopping rules, and for multiple tests.Chapter 12, regarding Bayesian approaches to null value assessment, has new material about the region of practical equivalence (ROPE), new examples of accepting the null value by Bayes factors, and new explanation of the Bayes factor in terms of the Savage-Dickey method.Chapter 13, regarding statistical power and sample size, has an extensive new section on sequential testing, and making the research goal be precision of e},

Looking at business ethics from the gender perspective made us ponder if it would be fruitful to analyse the feminine and masculine dimensions of decision-making style. The article follows the research tradition using the multidimensional ethics scale, and it aims at developing the scale to better include female decision-making. We came to the conclusion that, as the multidimensional ethics scale used in measuring managers' moral decision-making is derived from modern ethical theories focusing on indications of masculinities more than femininities, the scale leaves feminine decision-making dimensions invisible. Our argument is that in seeking a deeper understanding of (female) managers' moral decision-making, we must find a broader basis for the analysis and develop the scale further so that it allows different voices to be heard and different dimensions to be seen.},

Over the past two decades, advances in network science and graph theoretical methods have led to the development of computational semantic networks. This review provides a modern perspective on how computational semantic networks have proven to be useful tools to investigate the structure of semantic memory as well as search and retrieval processes within semantic memory, to ultimately model performance in a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Regarding representation, the review focuses on the distinctions and similarities between network-based (based on behavioral norms) approaches and more recent distributional (based on natural language corpora) semantic models, and the potential overlap between the two approaches. Capturing the type of relation between concepts appears to be particularly important in this modeling endeavor. Regarding processes, the review focuses on random walk models and the degree to which retrieval processes demand attention in pursuit of given task goals, which dovetails with the type of relation retrieved during tasks. Ultimately, this review provides a critical assessment of how the network perspective can be reconciled with distributional and machine-learning-based perspectives to meaning representation, and describes how cognitive network science provides a useful conceptual toolkit to probe both the structure and retrieval processes within semantic memory.},

  abstract = {Adult semantic memory has been traditionally conceptualized as a relatively static memory system that consists of knowledge about the world, concepts, and symbols. Considerable work in the past few decades has challenged this static view of semantic memory, and instead proposed a more fluid and flexible system that is sensitive to context, task demands, and perceptual and sensorimotor information from the environment. This paper (1) reviews traditional and modern computational models of semantic memory, within the umbrella of network (free association-based), feature (property generation norms-based), and distributional semantic (natural language corpora-based) models, (2) discusses the contribution of these models to important debates in the literature regarding knowledge representation (localist vs. distributed representations) and learning (error-free/Hebbian learning vs. error-driven/predictive learning), and (3) evaluates how modern computational models (neural network, retrieval-based, and topic models) are revisiting the traditional ``static'' conceptualization of semantic memory and tackling important challenges in semantic modeling such as addressing temporal, contextual, and attentional influences, as well as incorporating grounding and compositionality into semantic representations. The review also identifies new challenges regarding the abundance and availability of data, the generalization of semantic models to other languages, and the role of social interaction and collaboration in language learning and development. The concluding section advocates the need for integrating representational accounts of semantic memory with process-based accounts of cognitive behavior, as well as the need for explicit comparisons of computational models to human baselines in semantic tasks to adequately assess their psychological plausibility as models of human semantic memory.},

Innovations in ubiquitous and networked computing such as wearable locating systems for passengers could enable faster muster and more efficient search for missing people. As the safety enhancement depends on the effective usage of these technologies, passengers' acceptance is crucial, though largely unknown, and infrastructure implies high costs for shipping companies. In order to investigate passengers' acceptance, a context-specific technology acceptance model was developed based on a literature review and qualitative interviews with passengers. The model was validated by an online survey with 2086 passengers aged between 16 and 81~years. The context-specific factorssocial influence,expected usefulness,trust,privacy concern, andperceived security riskexplain 95\% of the variance in the target variableintention to uselocating systems withsocial influenceas the strongest predictor. The context-specific factors are most determined by the passenger characteristicsageandneed for safety. In conclusion, the model presents insights into the relationships between passenger characteristics and context-specific factors enabling systematic interventions to increase acceptance for locating systems and, thereby, contributes to enhance safety for the occurrence of an evacuation.},

This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.},

To ensure that a study is adequately powered to yield informative results with an ANOVA, researchers can perform an a priori power analysis. However, power analysis for factorial ANOVA designs is often a challenge. Current software solutions do not allow power analyses for complex designs with several within-participants factors. Moreover, power analyses often need {$\eta$}2p or Cohen's f as input, but these effect sizes are not intuitive and do not generalize to different experimental designs. We have created the R package Superpower and online Shiny apps to enable researchers without extensive programming experience to perform simulation-based power analysis for ANOVA designs of up to three within- or between-participants factors. Predicted effects are entered by specifying means, standard deviations, and, for within-participants factors, the correlations. The simulation provides the statistical power for all ANOVA main effects, interactions, and individual comparisons. The software can plot power across a range of sample sizes, can control for multiple comparisons, and can compute power when the homogeneity or sphericity assumption is violated. This Tutorial demonstrates how to perform a priori power analysis to design informative studies for main effects, interactions, and individual comparisons and highlights important factors that determine the statistical power for factorial ANOVA designs.},

Despite the existence of different attempts to link the economy (or parts of it) to the evolution of the climate, results have often been disappointing and criticized. In this paper, we discuss the use of agent-based modeling for climate policy integrated assessment. First, we identify the main limitations of current mainstream models and stress how framing the problem from a complex system perspective might help, in particular when extreme climate conditions are at stake and general equilibrium effects are questionable. Second, we present two agent-based models that serve as prototypes for the analysis of coupled climate, energy, and macroeconomic dynamics. We argue that such models constitute examples of a promising approach for the integrated assessment of climate change and economic dynamics. They allow a bottom-up representation of climate damages and their cross-sectoral percolation, naturally embed distributional issues, and traditionally account for the role of finance in sustaining economic development and shaping the dynamics of energy transitions. All these issues are at the fore-front of the research in integrated assessment. Finally, we provide a careful discussion of testable policy exercises, modeling limitations, and open challenges for this stream of research. Notwithstanding great potential, there is a long way-to-go for agent-based models to catch-up with the richness of many existing integrated assessment models and overcome their major problems. This should encourage research in the area.},

In this paper, we introduce two new neural architectures---one based on bidirectional LSTMs and conditional random fields, and the other that constructs and labels segments using a transition-based approach inspired by shift-reduce parsers. Our models rely on two sources of information about words: character-based word representations learned from the supervised corpus and unsupervised word representations learned from unannotated corpora. Our models obtain state-of-the-art performance in NER in four languages without resorting to any language-specific knowledge or resources such as gazetteers.},

  abstract = {The term big data encompasses a wide range of approaches of collecting and analyzing data in ways that were not possible before the era of modern personal computing. One approach to big data of great potential to psychologists is web scraping, which involves the automated collection of information from webpages. Although web scraping can create massive big datasets with tens of thousands of variables, it can also be used to create modestly sized, more manageable datasets with tens of variables but hundreds of thousands of cases, well within the skillset of most psychologists to analyze, in a matter of hours. In this article, we demystify web scraping methods as currently used to examine research questions of interest to psychologists. First, we introduce an approach called theory-driven web scraping in which the choice to use web-based big data must follow substantive theory. Second, we introduce data source theories, a term used to describe the assumptions a researcher must make about a prospective big data source in order to meaningfully scrape data from it. Critically, researchers must derive specific hypotheses to be tested based upon their data source theory, and if these hypotheses are not empirically supported, plans to use that data source should be changed or eliminated. Third, we provide a case study and sample code in Python demonstrating how web scraping can be conducted to collect big data along with links to a web tutorial designed for psychologists. Fourth, we describe a 4-step process to be followed in web scraping projects. Fifth and finally, we discuss legal, practical and ethical concerns faced when conducting web scraping projects.

In short, evaluations are not based solely on message accuracy, but also on the extent to which the message and messenger are amenable to the values of one's social groups. Here, we use the release of Pope Francis's 2015 encyclical as the context for a natural experiment to examine the role of prior values in climate change cognition. Based on our analysis of panel data collected before and after the encyclical's release, we find that political ideology moderated views of papal credibility on climate change for those participants who were aware of the encyclical. We also find that, in some contexts, non-Catholics who were aware of the encyclical granted Pope Francis additional credibility compared to the non-Catholics who were unaware of it, yet Catholics granted the Pope high credibility regardless of encyclical awareness. Importantly, papal credibility mediated the conditional relationships between encyclical awareness and acceptance of the Pope's messages on climate change. We conclude by discussing how our results provide insight into cognitive processing of new information about controversial issues.},

Instead, people may worry these videos are brainwashing others. That individuals believe other people will be more influenced by media messages than themselves is called third-person perception (TPP), and the consequences from those perceptions, such as calls for censorship, are called third-person effects (TPE). Here, we conduct three studies that examine the flat Earth phenomenon using TPP and TPE as a theoretical framework. We first measured participants' own perceptions of the convincingness of flat Earth arguments presented in YouTube videos and compared these to participants' perceptions of how convincing others might find the arguments. Instead of merely looking at ratings of one's self vs. a general `other,' however, we asked people to consider a variety of identity groups who differ based on political party, religiosity, educational attainment, and area of residence (e.g., rural, urban). We found that participants' religiosity and political party were the strongest predictors of TPP across the different identity groups. In our second and third pre-registered studies, we found support for our first study's conclusions, and we found mixed evidence for whether TPP predict support for censoring YouTube among the public.},

The dataset can be used to train machine learning based classifiers for both stance and topic detection, either individually or simultaneously. BERT was used successfully for the combined task. The dataset can also be used to further study the prevalence of different conspiracy narratives. To this end we qualitatively analyze the tweets, discussing the structure of conspiracy narratives that are frequently found in the dataset.

  abstract = {The self-organized task switching paradigm enables to investigate the link between task performance and task selection in a voluntary task switching setting that benefits task switches over task repetitions. For example, waiting for a repetition-related stimulus onset denotes environmental costs, which are balanced with internal task-switch costs. Here we extent this research by asking whether movement effort also plays a crucial role for task selection. In detail, we investigate how motor-related consequences, i.e., increasing force for task repetitions, influence task-switching behavior. Participants voluntarily switched between a number (i.e., even or odd) or letter task (i.e., vowel or consonant) using a robot system for response execution. With consecutive task repetitions the robot system was harder to move to the response target as we systematically added a damping load. We found that switch rate correlated with cognitive switch costs (i.e., costs in: reaction time, r~=~-0.741, and error rate, r~=~-0.545), and motor repetition cost represented by movement-time increment, r~=~0.414. Interestingly, switch rate also correlated with individual force maximum, r~=~-0.480. However, switch rate did not correlate with movement-impulse increment, r~=~-0.033. Stepwise multiple regression analyses across participants revealed that 66\% of variance are explained including all predicting factors. Yet, only cognitive costs and individual force maximum reached significant importance in the regression model. Hence, we extended switch-rate analyses using linear regression on a within-subject level, and thus, keeping individual force maximum constant. We found about 84\% of variance explained by motor and cognitive costs. Thereby, movement impulse predicted task selection more than reaction time and more than movement time. Thus, we demonstrated that both cognitive and motor consequences influence task-switch behavior. Furthermore, we showed that task selection is importantly modulated by motor effort related to individual motor skills.},

The ``living'' materials facilitate unique properties, including autonomy, intelligent responses, self-repair, and even self-replication. Within this dawning field, current literature has classified ELMs mainly into biological ELMs (bio-ELMs), which are solely made of cells, and hybrid living materials (HLMs), consisting of abiotic scaffold and living cells. Considering that the most relevant feature of ELMs is the living cell colonies or micro-organisms, we consider that ELMs should be classified and presented differently, more related to life taxonomies than to materials science disciplines. Toward solving the current need for the classification of ELMs, this study presents the first complete proposal of taxonomy for these ELMs. Here, life taxonomies and materials classifications are hybridized hierarchically. Once the proposed taxonomy is explained, its applicability is illustrated by classifying several examples of bio-ELMs and HLMs, and its utility for guiding research in this field is analyzed. Finally, possible modifications and improvements are discussed, and a call for collaboration is launched for progressing in this complex and multidisciplinary field.},

In this paper we investigated the interplay between trust in a robot and people's perceptions of the robot's emotional intelligence. We used a vignette-based method to explore the following questions: (1) Do subjects perceive differences in robot EI, and is their trust in the robot influenced by differences in the robot's reliability and capability? (2) Does a robot's EI influence how much it is trusted and conversely does a robot's capability and reliability influence how emotionally intelligent it is perceived to be? (3) Do people trust male and female robots differently when the robots exhibit different levels of EI or different levels of capability and reliability, and do gender stereotypical expectations related to EI transfer to trust?; (4) Does focusing on the robot's EI increase one's trust in the robot? (5) Is the interplay between trust, EI and gender the same for different levels of evoked social presence and human-likeness (i.e., when the interaction is presented in different modalities, text or spoken dialogue when the robot's voice is actually heard)? We found that trust in the robot was influenced by the level of the robot's EI (p~{$<~$}.001) and that gender stereotypical expectations related to EI were transferred to trust (p~\$\$=\$\$~.006), but gender effects on trust disappeared when only capability and reliability (robot's trustworthiness) were manipulated but not the robot's EI (p~=~.103). Surprisingly, we found that people trusted the robot more when the interaction was presented in text format (p~\$\$=\$\$~.024), going against our hypothesis that spoken dialogue would evoke more social presence and thus bolster EI perception and instill more trust. We suggest that this effect might be due to people's expectations of a more expressive and human-like voice. Finally, we also found that people's trust ratings in the robot were higher when they were made to notice and think about the robot's EI, by answering EI questionnaires prior to trust questionnaires (p~=~.022). We discuss the implications of our findings for robot design and HRI research.},

A growing number of scholars and policymakers characterize the situation as a ``polycrisis.'' Yet this neologism remains poorly defined. We provide the concept with a substantive definition, highlight its value-added in comparison to related concepts, and provide a theoretical framework to explain the causal mechanisms currently entangling many of the world's crises. In this framework, a global crisis arises when one or more fast-moving trigger events combines with slow-moving stresses to push a global system out of its established equilibrium and into a volatile and harmful state of disequilibrium. We then identify three causal pathways\textemdash common stresses, domino effects, and inter-systemic feedbacks\textemdash that can connect multiple global systems to produce synchronized crises. Drawing on current examples, we show that the polycrisis concept is a valuable tool for understanding unfolding crises, generating actionable insights, and opening avenues for future research.},

However, there are a number of barriers to climate change research, stemming both from the nature of the research and the structure of institutions. This paper offers an overview of the barriers which hinder the handling of matters related to climate change at institutions of higher education (IHEs), and reports on an empirical study to investigate these barriers using a global survey of higher education institutions. It concludes by proposing some steps which could be followed with a view to making climate change more present and effective in university research and teaching. These include changing approaches to research, outreach and teaching to better support action on climate change.},

  abstract = {The Oxford Handbook of Qualitative Research presents a comprehensive overview of the field of qualitative research. It is intended for students of all levels, faculty, and researchers across the social sciences. The contributors represent some of the most influential and innovative researchers in the field as well as emerging scholars. This handbook provides a broad introduction to the field of qualitative research to those with little to no background in the subject, while simultaneously providing substantive contributions to the field that will be of interest to even the most experienced researchers. It serves as a user-friendly teaching tool suitable for a range of undergraduate or graduate courses, as well as individuals working on their thesis or other research projects. With a focus on methodological instruction, this volume offers both a retrospective and prospective view of the field. The first two sections explore the history of the field, ethics, and philosophical/theoretical approaches. The next three sections focus on the major methods of qualitative practice as well as newer approaches (such as arts-based research and internet research); area studies often excluded (such as museum studies and disaster studies); and mixed methods and participatory methods (such as community-based research). The next section covers key issues including data analysis, interpretation, writing and assessment. The final section offers a commentary about politics and research and the move towards public scholarship.},

Interactive vignettes maintain the advantages of traditional vignettes while offering additional affordances for participant interaction and data collection through interactive elements. We discuss the core affordances of interactive vignettes, including explorability, responsiveness, and non-linearity, and look into how these affordances can enable HRI research with more complex scenarios. To demonstrate the strength of the approach, we present a case study of our own research project with N=87 participants and show the data we collect through interactive vignettes. We suggest that the use of interactive vignettes can benefit HRI researchers in learning how participants interact with, respond to, and perceive a robot's behavior in pre-defined scenarios.},

The results were as follows: First, the hierarchical structure of the HEXACO-100 was clearly supported in two principal components analyses: each of the six factors was defined by its constituent facets and each of the 25 facets was defined by its constituent items. Second, the HEXACO-100 factor scales showed fairly low intercorrelations, with only one pair of scales (Honesty?Humility and Agreeableness) having an absolute correlation above .20 in self-report data. Third, the factor and facet scales showed strong self/observer convergent correlations, which far exceeded the self/observer discriminant correlations.},

There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The deformable property of soft robots restricts the use of many conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are preferable for soft robots. Sensors include low modulus ({$<$} 1 MPa) elastomers with liquid-phase material filled channels and are appropriate for proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature. In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed because the conventional control techniques may be inadequate to handle soft robots. Several innovative techniques and diverse materials \& fabrication methods are described in this review article. In addition, a wide range of soft robots are characterized and analyzed based on the following sub-categories; actuation, sensing, structure, control and electronics, materials, fabrication and system, and applications.},

When compared to the standardized scientific method for systematic reviews in HTA, the diversity of ethical analysis has been characterized as a fundamental barrier to the integration of ethics. The present paper aims to identify the theoretical and practical differences between the approaches underpinning ethical analysis in HTA and clarify the reasons for such diversity. Our systematic review of HTA literature pertaining to the barriers to the integration of ethics in HTA identified nine ethical approaches: Principlism, Casuistry, Coherence Analysis, Wide Reflective Equilibrium, Axiology, the Socratic approach, the Triangular model, Constructive Technology Assessment and Social Shaping of Technology. Citations pertaining to each approach were extracted and categorized according to three constitutive components of ethical argumentation established in a previous research evaluating nanotechnologies: i) the disciplinary foundation that grounds the validity of the ethical evaluation, ii) the characteristics of such evaluation, iii) the operational process involved in applying it to a particular case (i.e., its practical reasoning). This comparison shows that, 1) the difference between these approaches rests primarily on their disciplinary foundation (rooted in philosophy, philosophy/theology, or sociology), 2) their complexity can be observed in the distinct characteristics of ethical evaluation deriving from their differing disciplinary foundation, and 3) although four different types of operationalization procedure were identified, little information was available in regards to the practical reasoning associated with these approaches.},

One such norm is to distort one's own response in a socially desirable direction during interviews. However, findings for such an effect are mixed in the literature. Therefore, a new study on the effect of social desirability bias in human\textendash robot evaluation was conducted, aiming for a conceptual replication of previous findings. In a between-subject laboratory experiment, \$\$N = 107\$\$participants had to evaluate the robot and the interaction quality after a short conversation in three different groups: In one group, the evaluation was conducted using (1) the same robot of the former interaction, (2) a different robot, (3) a tablet computer. According to the CASA assumption, it was expected, that evaluations on likability and quality of interaction, are higher in the condition with the same robot conducting the evaluation, compared to a different robot or a tablet computer because robots are treated as social actors and hence humans distort ratings in a socially desirable direction. Based on previous findings, we expected robots to evoke higher anthropomorphism and feelings of social presence compared to the tablet computer as potential explanation. However, the data did not support the hypotheses. Low sample size, low statistical power, lack of measurement validation and other problems that could lead to an overestimation of effect sizes\textemdash in this study and the literature in general\textemdash are discussed in light of the replicability crisis.},

  abstract = {A Single Cohesive Framework of Tools and Procedures for Psychometrics and Assessment Bayesian Psychometric Modeling presents a unified Bayesian approach across traditionally separate families of psychometric models. It shows that Bayesian techniques, as alternatives to conventional approaches, offer distinct and profound advantages in achieving many goals of psychometrics.  Adopting a Bayesian approach can aid in unifying seemingly disparate\textemdash and sometimes conflicting\textemdash ideas and activities in psychometrics. This book explains both how to perform psychometrics using Bayesian methods and why many of the activities in psychometrics align with Bayesian thinking.  The first part of the book introduces foundational principles and statistical models, including conceptual issues, normal distribution models, Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation, and regression. Focusing more directly on psychometrics, the second part covers popular psychometric models, including classical test theory, factor analysis, item response theory, latent class analysis, and Bayesian networks. Throughout the book, procedures are illustrated using examples primarily from educational assessments. A supplementary website provides the datasets, WinBUGS code, R code, and Netica files used in the examples.},

Climate change also challenges many people's worldview because any climate mitigation regime will have economic and political implications that are incompatible with libertarian ideals of unregulated free markets. These political implications have created an environment of rhetorical adversity in which disinformation abounds, thus compounding the challenges for climate communicators. The existing literature on how to communicate climate change and dispel misinformation converges on several conclusions: First, providing information about climate change, in particular explanations of why it occurs, can enhance people's acceptance of science. Second, highlighting the scientific consensus can be an effective means to counter misinformation and raise public acceptance. Third, culturally aligned messages and messengers are more likely to be successful. Finally, climate misinformation is best defanged, through a process known as inoculation, before it is encountered, although debunking techniques can also be successful.},

Numerous causes of the crisis have been identified, such as underpowered studies, publication bias, imprecise theories, and inadequate statistical procedures. The replication crisis is real, but it is less clear how it should be resolved. Here we examine potential solutions by modeling a scientific community under various different replication regimes. In one regime, all findings are replicated before publication to guard against subsequent replication failures. In an alternative regime, individual studies are published and are replicated after publication, but only if they attract the community's interest. We find that the publication of potentially non-replicable studies minimizes cost and maximizes efficiency of knowledge gain for the scientific community under a variety of assumptions. Provided it is properly managed, our findings suggest that low replicability can support robust and efficient science.},

The effect of this content on people's attitudes is not fully understood. In particular, it is unknown how the interaction between the content of blog posts and blog comments affects readers' attitudes. We report an experiment that orthogonally varied those two variables using blog posts and comments that either did, or did not, support the scientific consensus on climate change. We find that beliefs are partially shaped by readers' perception of how widely an opinion expressed in a blog post appears to be shared by other readers. The perceived social consensus among readers, in turn, is determined by whether blog comments endorse or reject the contents of a post. When comments reject the content, perceived reader consensus is lower than when comments endorse the content. The results underscore the importance of perceived social consensus on opinion formation.},

  abstract = {Some scientific propositions are so well established that they are no longer debated by the relevant scientific community, such as the fact that greenhouse gas emissions are altering the Earth's climate. In many cases, such scientifically settled issues are nonetheless rejected by segments of the public. U.S. surveys have repeatedly shown that the rejection of scientific evidence across a broad range of domains is preferentially associated with rightwing or libertarian worldviews, with little evidence for rejection of scientific evidence by people on the political left. We report two preregistered representative surveys (each N~{$>~$}1000) that (1) sought to explain this apparent political asymmetry and (2) continued the search for the rejection of scientific evidence on the political left. To address the first question, we focused on Merton's classic analysis of the norms of science, such as communism and universalism, which continue to be internalized by the scientific community but which are not readily reconciled with conservative values. Both studies show that people's political worldviews are associated with their attitudes towards those scientific norms, and that those attitudes predict people's acceptance of vaccinations and climate science. The norms of science may thus be in latent conflict with the worldviews of a substantial segment of the public. To address the second question, we examined people's views on the role of inheritance in determining people's intelligence, given that the belief in the power of learning and environmental factors to shape human development is a guiding principle of leftwing thought. We find no association between core measures of political worldviews and people's view of heritability of intelligence, although two subordinate constructs, nationalism and social dominance orientation, were associated with belief in heritability.},

  abstract = {One of the main themes that has emerged from behavioral decision research during the past three decades is the view that people's preferences are often constructed in the process of elicitation. This idea is derived from studies demonstrating that normatively equivalent methods of elicitation (e.g., choice and pricing) give rise to systematically different responses. These preference reversals violate the principle of procedure invariance that is fundamental to all theories of rational choice. If different elicitation procedures produce different orderings of options, how can preferences be defined and in what sense do they exist? This book shows not only the historical roots of preference construction but also the blossoming of the concept within psychology, law, marketing, philosophy, environmental policy, and economics. Decision making is now understood to be a highly contingent form of information processing, sensitive to task complexity, time pressure, response mode, framing, reference points, and other contextual factors.},

While the use of robots is regarded as one of the most important trends in service marketing, customer acceptance is still a major barrier to their application in service scenarios. This study examines robot characteristics (anthropomorphism, autonomy) and customer characteristics (role clarity, ability) as antecedents affecting customer acceptance of service robots from the perspective of service encounters. Subsequently, the study develops a conceptual model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of 406 respondents from an online survey in China was used to test the proposed conceptual model. The results show that anthropomorphism, autonomy, and ability are positively related to perceived usefulness, while autonomy, ability, and role clarity are positively related to perceived ease of use. Both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are significant antecedents of customer attitude. Customer attitude determines customer acceptance of service robots in service encounters. Our findings have implications for both researchers and practitioners.},

Contrary to this, consumers almost exclusively refer to the packaging material when it comes to their perceptions of the environmental impact of packaging. Paper-based packaging is strongly understood by the surveyed consumers to be environmentally advantageous, whereas plastic and metal are not. This study further indicates that a majority of the Swedish consumers surveyed are aware of their shortcomings in judging the environmental status of food packaging, indicating a need for guidance; otherwise, consumer choices can unintendedly counteract environmentally sustainable intentions.

  abstract = {The literature on climate engineering, or geoengineering, covers a wide range of potential methods for solar radiation management or carbon dioxide removal that vary in technical aspects, temporal and spatial scales, potential environmental impacts, and legal, ethical, and governance challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive review of social and natural science papers on this topic since 2006 and listed in SCOPUS and Web of Science. It adds to previous literature reviews by combining analyses of bibliometric patterns and of trends in how the technologies are framed in terms of content, motivations, stakes, and recommendations. Most peer-reviewed climate engineering literature does not weigh the risks and new, additional, benefits of the various technologies, but emphasizes either the potential dangers of climate engineering or the climate change consequences of refraining from considering the research, development, demonstration, and/or deployment of climate engineering technologies. To analyse this polarity, not prevalent in the literature on earlier emerging technologies, we explore the concept of dual high-stake technologies. As appeals to fear have proven ineffective in spurring public engagement in climate change, we may not expect significant public support for climate engineering technologies whose rationale is not to achieve benefits in addition to avoiding the high stakes of climate change. Furthermore, in designing public engagement exercises, researchers must be careful not to steer discussions by emphasizing one type of stake framing over another. A dual high-stake, rather than risk\textendash benefit, framing should also be considered in analysing some emerging technologies with similar characteristics, for example, nanotechnology for pollution control.

The effect of personality is most evident in US consumers with five out of six personality traits explaining preferences for genetically modified pork. Openness was the only trait that consistently explained consumer acceptance in our three countries and conscientiousness was found to be a good predictor in Western cultures. Our results reinforce the need to use psychological characteristics of consumers to understand controversial food acceptance and highlight the differential impact of personality across cultures.},

  abstract = {The promotion of energy and resource-saving behaviour is one of the primary tools to enhance the reduction of resource consumption and seeking energy and resource efficiency. The aim of this study was, referring to the Campbell paradigm and goal framing theory, to analyse the main determinants of different types of energy and resource-saving behaviours in the European Union (EU) countries. Therefore, it was analysed whether environmental and health concerns and environmental responsibility equally influenced pro-environmental behaviours and whether all types of behaviours related to energy and resource-saving were guided by the same goals. The results showed that the performance of energy and resource-saving behaviours varied across European countries, and in separate EU countries, people were more willing to perform different types of behaviour. Furthermore, respondents who were more concerned about environmental issues and health and were more environmentally responsible tended to perform a variety of actions related to energy and resource-saving. Considering separate behaviours related to energy and resource-saving, environmental responsibility significantly and positively influenced all behaviours. Environmental concern significantly and positively determined all types of behaviours except water-saving behaviour. Health concerns significantly and positively influenced only the avoidance of buying over-packaged products. The analysis of relationships among separate behaviours revealed that behaviours related to energy and resource-saving were guided by different goals and the cost of these behaviours were different. Thus, policymakers should consider these goals to promote energy and resource-saving behaviour in the household sector.},

  abstract = {Science depends on judgments of the bearing of evidence on theory. Scientists must judge whether an observation or the result of an experiment supports, disconfirms, or is simply irrelevant to a given hypothesis. Similarly, scientists may judge that, given all the available evidence, a hypothesis ought to be accepted as correct or nearly so, rejected as false, or neither. Occasionally, these evidential judgments can be make on deductive grounds. If an experimental result strictly contradicts a hypothesis, then the truth of the evidence deductively entails the falsity of the hypothesis. In the great majority of cases, however, the connection between evidence and hypothesis is nondemonstrative or inductive. In particular, this is so whenever a general hypothesis is inferred to be correct on the basis of the available data, since the truth of the data will not deductively entail the truth of the hypothesis. It always remains possible that the hypothesis is false even though the data are correct.},

According to technology acceptance theory, the public's attention and sentiment orientation have a strong influence on acceptance-behavior toward something new. Therefore, in this study, text-mining analysis is used to analyze social media text data to explore the current status, temporal and spatial trends of public attention, sentiment orientation, and focus on recycled water in China. The behavior over the past six years of Weibo users in 34 provincial-level administrative regions was analyzed, and the results show the following. Although public attention has increased significantly as a result of government actions, it is still at a low level. Residents pay more attention to recycled water in water-scarce and high-economic-development areas than others. In addition, the majority of the Chinese public holds positive feelings about recycled water. However, there is widespread disgust at the thought of recycled wastewater, and the public's concerns about its safety cannot be ignored.},

In particular, EMIs in which the intervention is delivered on a daily basis (daily interventions) can be easily combined with daily diary studies to analyse intervention effects on dependent variables (DVs) that fluctuate over time. This article first provides a typology of research designs to classify daily intervention studies according to (1) the type of assessment of the DV (global assessment on a small number of fixed occasions, daily assessment, and repeated assessment within days) and (2) the type of control (within-subjects vs. between-subjects designs) used in the studies. We then demonstrate how multilevel models can be used to examine the effects of a daily intervention on the mean levels of the DV. We differentiate between general effectiveness, differential effectiveness, and conditional effectiveness and show how these effects are represented in the models. As an illustration, we apply some of the models to data from a daily intervention workplace study (N = 51 full-time employees) that focused on the effects of savouring exercises on calm mood and vigour. Practitioner points In work and organizational psychology, a recent trend in intervention study designs is to implement an intervention on a daily basis and incorporate a daily diary assessment approach. To examine intervention effectiveness in pre-/post-designs, multilevel models are the method of choice because they circumvent the shortcomings of ANOVA approaches. In intervention studies with daily assessments, multilevel models can be applied to examine the intervention's general effectiveness and differential effectiveness (i.e., Who benefits more from the intervention?). Daily intervention studies with repeated assessments within days allow researchers to examine conditional effectiveness (i.e., On which days is the intervention more effective?).},

The results showed that: the public's attention toward green buildings has enhanced significantly with the change of government governance ideas, but still needs to be improved. Although vertical greening houses possess good heat preservation and thermal insulation, 46.32\% of the Chinese public has negative sentiments toward vertical greening houses mainly due to worries about the increase in snakes, and mosquitoes and other insects caused by the increased vegetation cover.

Science and technology obviously have an essential role to play in addressing these challenges but have to be supplemented by the collaboration of different actors from the scientific and non-scientific community. Possibly beneficial technologies can only unfold their full potential if they are socially accepted. Participation and transdisciplinarity are key concepts in this regard. The need for methods fostering collaborative knowledge production and reverse communication from the public to the scientific community is accordingly high. In this article, we propose to apply CognitiveAffective Mapping (CAM) to predict psychological acceptance of novel research fields and potentially resulting technologies. As an example, we use life-like materials systems. CAM enables acceptance prediction at an early stage\textemdash already for basic research when prototypes are not yet available. The method bridges the gap between qualitative and quantitative research traditions. Its product\textemdash Cognitive-Affective Maps (CAMs)\textemdash is a vivid visual tool. In perspective, CAM-based technology acceptance assessment can be conceived as a participatory, transdisciplinary practice.},

Drawing on research from clinical, physiological, and other subfields of psychology, they show that emotional reactions to risky situations often diverge from cognitive assessments of those risks. When such divergence occurs, emotional reactions often drive behavior. The risk-as-feelings hypothesis is shown to explain a wide range of phenomena that have resisted interpretation in cognitive\textendash consequentialist terms.

From a sample of the Spanish population, participants were 284 people (50.3\% female), with a driver's license, car owners and residents in cities of various sizes, who completed an anonymous questionnaire. The effect of each type of variable was estimated by a structural equation model. Results indicate that people's affective link with their private vehicle explains 12\% of frequency of car use, as a latent variable of different kinds of trips: visiting friends or relatives, going to work or to a study center, going shopping, or to leisure areas. The instrumental advantages associated with cars and thinking that it expresses one's status predict the affective link with the car. These findings corroborate the relevance of the non-instrumental aspects involved in the selection of the means of transportation.},

Various psychological theories of persuasive communication at the individual level are implemented as simulation experiments. The model allows us to investigate the effects of contagion and assimilation, motivated cognition, polarity, source credibility, and idiosyncratic attitude formation. Simulations show that different theories produce different characteristic macrolevel patterns. Contagion and assimilation are central mechanisms for generating consensus, however, contagion generates a radicalized consensus. Motivated cognition causes societal polarization or the fragmentation of attitudes. Polarity and source credibility have comparatively little effect on the societal distribution of attitudes. We discuss how the simulations provide a bridge between microlevel psychological theories and the aggregated macrolevel studied by sociology. This approach enables new types of evidence for evaluating psychological theory to complement experimental approaches, thus answering calls to enhance the role of coherent and formalized theory in psychological science.

We summarize how RRI emerged in the academic literature, showing evidence of conflicting definitions and interpretations. Using computational tools and methodologies of network and text analysis, the discursive content of a large set of peer-reviewed articles was analysed. Results show that RRI is gradually becoming more multidisciplinary, and also that the academic discourse is increasingly more focused on public engagement and ethics, leaving aside other dimensions of RRI proposed by the official European policy discourse. We conducted directed content analysis with the purpose of deepening and discussing the findings, and conclude that the increasing multidisciplinarity of RRI and the ideological potential that emerges from the relation between the dimensions of ethics and engagement are the factors that most contribute to the lack of consensus in the definition of RRI.},

  abstract = {Identity is suggested to have profound environmental implications. However, the magnitude of the relationship between identity and environmental concern varied considerably in previous studies. As the first meta-analysis study to systematically review this topic, we followed previous conceptual discussions to evaluate the relations between four types of identity and environmental concern, which was measured by the new environmental paradigm. Results showed that environmental identity (N~=~15,884; r~=~0.45), pro-environmental self-identity (N~=~4695; r~=~0.50), relationship self-expansion identity (N~=~8144; r~=~0.31), and egoistic identity (N~=~13,228; r~=~-0.10) were all associated with environmental concern. Heterogeneity among the effect sizes was partly explained by societal collectivism-individualism, such that stronger relationships of environmental and self-expansion identities with environmental concern and a weaker relationship between egoistic identity and environmental concern were found in more collectivistic societies. These findings highlight the importance of differentiating the types of identity and acknowledging the powerful moderating role of cultural contexts in environmental research.},

The Ethical Standards of Judgement Questionnaire (ESJQ) is validated via six studies (total n\,{$>$}\,2400). Measurement items are developed in the first three studies, which also confirm the need to eliminate a unidimensional measure and evaluate these frameworks separately. The fourth study addresses discriminant validity and the two remaining studies provide insight into how consequentialism and formalism predict the degree to which behaviors are deemed acceptable by individuals in the context of consumer beliefs and religious beliefs. Suggested uses for the scale in both academia and organizations are presented.},

In the context of democratic governance of emerging technologies, not only it is important to reflect on technologies' moral significance, but also to address their emerging and future oriented character. The book proposes an original approach to deal with the issue of ``plausible'' ethical evaluation of new technologies. Taking its start from current debates about Technology Assessment, the proposed solution emerges as a combination of theoretical and methodological insights from the fields of Philosophy of Technology, Science and Technology Studies and a normative justification based on pragmatist ethics. The book's main contribution is to engage a diverse and interdisciplinary audience (ethicists, philosophers, social scientists, technology assessment researchers and practitioners) in a reflection concerning the epistemological challenges that are associated to the endeavour of appraising the moral significance of emerging technologies in the attempt of democratically governing them. It brings together concepts and methodologies from different disciplines and shows their synergy in applying them to two specific case studies of emerging biomedical technologies.},

Using the CNI model to disentangle (a) sensitivity to consequences, (b) sensitivity to moral norms, and (c) general preference for inaction versus action in responses to moral dilemmas, the current research examined the temporal stability of individual differences along the three dimensions. Across two time points 1 month apart, sensitivity to consequences (r = .81) and sensitivity to norms (r = .84) showed high levels of stability that were comparable to the Big Five personality traits; general preference for inaction versus action showed lower stability (r = .41). Exploratory analyses revealed reliable associations between the three dimensions of moral dilemma judgments and three of the Big Five (extraversion, agreeableness, openness). Together, these findings provide evidence for stable individual differences in moral dilemma judgments that are related to basic personality traits.},

How the public perceives the COVID-19 vaccine is directly associated with vaccine compliance and vaccination coverage. This study takes a cultural sensitivity perspective and adopts two well-known social media platforms in the United States (Twitter) and China (Weibo) to conduct a public perception comparison around the COVID-19 vaccine. By implementing semantic network analysis, results demonstrate that the two countries' social media users overlapped in themes concerning domestic vaccination policies, priority groups, challenges from COVID-19 variants, and the global pandemic situation. However, Twitter users were prone to disclose individual vaccination experiences, express anti-vaccine attitudes. In comparison, Weibo users manifested evident deference to authorities and exhibited more positive feelings toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Those disparities were explained by the cultural characteristics' differences between the two countries. The findings provide insights into comprehending public health issues in cross-cultural contexts and illustrate the potential of utilizing social media to conduct health informatics studies and investigate public perceptions during public health crisis time.},

We assume, however, in this paper the idea of a discursive production of knowledge on the application of an innovation across different levels of the education system. We aim to shed light on an innovation's `journey' from educational policy over training providers to teams of professionals in early childhood education and care (ECEC). By investigating knowledge and emotions associated with the introduction of an intended innovation using the example of ``stimulation interactions'' in day care-centers, the paper contributes to research on the transfer of innovations in education. To better understand challenges occurring during the transfer of innovations, we triangulate methods from discourse theory (coding techniques based on GTM) and cognitive science, namely cognitive-affective mapping (according to the scholarly conventions). The data corpus includes educational plans (N = 2), in-service training programs (N = 123) and group discussions of pedagogical teams (N = 6) who participated in an in-service training on the subject, stimulating interaction. Findings underline that similar messages from the inventors on the educational policy level are received and processed heterogeneously by the teams of pedagogues as a result of their preexisting views, routine practices and experiences with intended innovations through in-service trainings. Besides, a diffuse mixture of competing and contradictory information is communicated to the professionals and, hence, collides with the in-service training providers' and educational policy actors' expectations on the processing of the intended innovation. Specific knowledge elements and their valences are diametrically opposed to each other. Dissonances like these are considered as obstacles to social innovation. The obstacles are caused by the lack of a `common language' beyond all levels. Hence, policy-makers and in-service-training providers should anticipate the supportive as well as competing knowledge-emotional complexes of professionals and take these into account when communicating an intended innovation.},

This insight lies at the heart of attitude strength, which is defined as an attitude's durability and impact. A variety of attitude attributes such as certainty and ambivalence have been shown to correlate with these aspects of attitude strength, which has made for some confusion as to what variables define strong attitudes versus predict an attitude's strength. In this article, we highlight this distinction between predictors and defining features of strength and review recent programs of research demonstrating the independence of strength-related attitude attributes and attitude strength itself. Specifically, although some attitude attributes are associated with the attitude's durability and impact, there are conditions under which those attributes fail to predict attitude strength or even have the opposite effects. Throughout, this review reveals nuances in the attitude strength literature and provokes new questions for future inquiry.},

To address this gap, we present the results of an experimental vignette study that includes antecedents from the privacy, robotics, technology adoption, and trust literature. Using linear regression analysis, with the privacy-invasiveness of a fictional but realistic robot as the key manipulation, we show that privacy concerns affect use intention significantly and negatively. Compared with earlier work done through a survey, where we found a robot privacy paradox, the experimental vignette approach allows for a more realistic and tangible assessment of respondents' concerns and behavioral intentions, showing how potential robot users take into account privacy as consideration for future behavior. We contextualize our findings within broader debates on privacy and data protection with smart technologies.},

Additionally, their performance in the examination was recorded. The structural equation model showed that statistics anxiety held a crucial role as the strongest direct predictor of performance. Students with higher statistics anxiety achieved less in the examination and showed higher procrastination scores. Statistics anxiety was related indirectly to spending less effort and time on learning. Trait anxiety was related positively to statistics anxiety and, counterintuitively, to academic performance. This result can be explained by the heterogeneity of the measure of trait anxiety. The part of trait anxiety that is unrelated to the specific part of statistics anxiety correlated positively with performance.},

In this paper, we operate on the assumption that while democratic processes cannot guarantee specific policy outcomes (without losing some of their legitimacy), certain types of democratic practices \textendash{} such as deliberation \textendash{} can be used to encourage people to support environmental policies. We test this assumption with an experiment that was designed to examine whether there are systematic differences in support for climate action policies among groups of people who deliberated the policies with each other and those who did not. In our experiment, 330 participants were asked to consider two policies designed to help mitigate climate change: (1) increases to the US federal gas tax; and (2) a tree planting policy. Our results show that those who deliberated became more supportive of government action on the gas tax policy, and they also became more willing to pay higher gas taxes than those who did not deliberate. These findings are consistent across model specifications and substantively significant.},

  abstract = {Consideration of solar geoengineering as a potential response to climate change will demand complex decisions. These include not only the choice of whether to deploy solar engineering, but decisions regarding how to deploy, and ongoing decision-making throughout deployment. Research on the governance of solar geoengineering to date has primarily engaged only with the question of whether to deploy. We examine the science of solar geoengineering in order to clarify the technical dimensions of decisions about deployment \textendash{} both strategic and operational \textendash{} and how these might influence governance considerations, while consciously refraining from making specific recommendations. The focus here is on a hypothetical deployment rather than governance of the research itself. We first consider the complexity surrounding the design of a deployment scheme, in particular the complicated and difficult decision of what its objective(s) would be, given that different choices for how to deploy will lead to different climate outcomes. Next, we discuss the on-going decisions across multiple timescales, from the sub-annual to the multi-decadal. For example, feedback approaches might effectively manage some uncertainties, but would require frequent adjustments to the solar geoengineering deployment in response to observations. Other decisions would be tied to the inherently slow process of detection and attribution of climate effects in the presence of natural variability. Both of these present challenges to decision-making. These considerations point toward particular governance requirements, including an important role for technical experts \textendash{} with all the challenges that entails.Key policy insights Decisions about solar geoengineering deployment will be informed not only by political choices, but also by climate science and engineering.Design decisions will pertain to the spatial and temporal goals of a climate intervention and strategies for achieving those goals.Some uncertainty can be managed through feedback, but this would require frequent operational decisions.Some strategic decisions will depend on the detection and attribution of climatic effects from solar geoengineering, which may take decades.Governance for solar geoengineering deployment will likely need to incorporate technical expertise for making short-term adjustments to the deployment and conducting attribution analysis, while also slowing down decisions made in response to attribution analysis to avoid hasty choices.},

When probed, these have tended to be explained either in cognitive social psychological terms, typically in the form of cognitive shortcuts or heuristics or the influence of affective variables, or in social interactionist terms, as a product of the micro dynamics of the social interaction. We argue for an alternative approach that examines how public attitudes are formed in relation to the interplay of wider cultural narratives about science and technology. Using data from recent qualitative research with publics on nanotechnology and other emerging technologies, we develop a typology of five cultural narratives that underpin and structure public talk. The narratives we identify within focus group talk are familiar stories that are deeply embedded in contemporary culture, and which provide cultural resources for navigating the issues posed by emerging technology. Substantively, they inform a `tragic' mood on the prospects of emerging technology, reflecting the loss of belief in science, when coupled to neo-liberal logics, as guaranteeing social progress. The implications for policy-making are discussed.},

Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store {$>$}30,000\,Tg\,C across \textasciitilde 185\,million\,ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141\textendash 466)\,Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2\textendash 3.2\,million\,ha for tidal marshes, 8.3\textendash 25.4\,million\,ha for seagrasses and 9\textendash 13\,million\,ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621\textendash 1,064)\,Tg\,CO2e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to \textasciitilde 3\% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.},

Unlike mitigation, solar geoengineering could quickly and cheaply lower global temperatures. It is also imperfect. Its environmental impacts remain unpredictable, and its low cost and immediate effects may result in `moral hazard,' potentially crowding out costly mitigation efforts. There is little understanding about how the public will respond to such tradeoffs. To address this, a 1000-subject nationally representative poll focused on solar geoengineering was conducted as part of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the US electorate in October\textendash November 2016. The importance that individuals place on solar geoengineering's speed and cost predicts their support for it, but there is little to no relationship between their concerns about its shortcomings and support for its research and use. Acquiescence bias appears to be an important factor for attitudes around solar geoengineering and moral hazard.},

For carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), there are now quite a few surveys of public attitudes towards CCS that are being used to inform the design of SI efforts. These surveys, focused on the nascent commercial deployment of CCS technologies, have demonstrated that the general public has little knowledge about CCS\textemdash yet the surveys go on to collect what are known as ``pseudo opinions'' or ``non-attitudes'' of respondents who know little or nothing about CCS. Beyond establishing the lack of knowledge about CCS, the results of these surveys should not be relied upon by the larger CCS community and public and private decision makers to inform the critical task of implementing and executing SI activities. The paper discusses the issues involved in providing information as part of the survey, maintaining that such information is never unbiased and thus tends to produce pseudo opinions that reflect the pollster's or researcher's bias. Other content and methodological issues are discussed, leading to the conclusion that most of the survey results should be used neither as a gauge of public attitudes nor as an indication of public acceptance. Then the framing of SI in CCS is examined, including the assumptions that clear stakeholder acceptance is a realistic goal and that the public has a decisive say in choosing the energy technologies of the present and the future. Finally, a broader suite of SI activities is recommended as more suited to realistic and contextual goals.},

Across multiple models, we found consistent and significant relationships between these network variables and the PCT in both the Canadian and German sample. Our results provide unique insights into individuals' thinking and perceptions of the viral outbreak. Our results also demonstrate that a network analysis of CAMs' properties is a promising method to study the relationship between human thought and affective connotation. We suggest that CAMs can bridge several gaps between qualitative and quantitative methods. Unlike when using quantitative tools (e.g., questionnaires), participants' answers are not restricted by response items as participants are free to incorporate any thoughts and feelings on the given topic. Furthermore, as compared to traditional qualitative measures, such as structured interviews, the CAM technique may better enable researchers to objectively assess and integrate the substance of a shared experience for large samples of participants.},

The book broadens traditional approaches and tools to include the analysis of actors and networks related to the problem at hand. It also shows how lessons learned in the application process can be used to improve the approaches and tools used in the design process. The book offers guidance in identifying and applying appropriate approaches and tools to design plans, as well as advice on implementing these plans in the real world. For decisionmakers and practitioners, the book includes realistic examples and practical guidelines that should help them understand what decisionmaking under deep uncertainty is and how it may be of assistance to them. Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty: From Theory to Practice is divided into four parts. Part I presents five approaches for designing strategic plans under deep uncertainty: Robust Decision Making, Dynamic Adaptive Planning, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways, Info-Gap Decision Theory, and Engineering Options Analysis. Each approach is worked out in terms of its theoretical foundations, methodological steps to follow when using the approach, latest methodological insights, and challenges for improvement. In Part II, applications of each of these approaches are presented. Based on recent case studies, the practical implications of applying each approach are discussed in depth. Part III focuses on using the approaches and tools in real-world contexts, based on insights from real-world cases. Part IV contains conclusions and a synthesis of the lessons that can be drawn for designing, applying, and implementing strategic plans under deep uncertainty, as well as recommendations for future work. The publication of this book has been funded by the Radboud University, the RAND Corporation, Delft University of Technology, and Deltares. ; Offers a comprehensive examination of the approaches and tools for designing plans under deep uncertainty and their application Identifies barriers and enablers for the use of the various approaches and tools in practice Includes realistic examples and practical guidelines to help readers better understand the concepts},

Editors Peter Marsden (Harvard University) and James D. Wright (University of Central Florida), long-time editor of Elsevier's Social Science Research, have created an authoritative reference book and an excellent starting point for anyone requiring a broad examination of the field. Detailed chapters include: sampling; measurement; questionnaire construction and question writing; survey implementation and management; survey data analysis; special types of surveys; and integrating surveys with other data collection methods. This handbook is distinguished from other texts by its greater comprehensiveness and depth of coverage including topics such as measurement models, the role of cognitive psychology, surveying networks, and cross-national/cross-cultural surveys. Timely and relevant it includes materials that are only now becoming highly influential topics.},

Ogburn's cultural lag thesis, an inherent conflict is proposed between the rapid speed of modern technological advances and the slower speed by which ethical guidelines for utilization of new technologies are developed. Ogburn's cultural lag thesis proposes that material culture advances more rapidly than non-material culture. Technology is viewed as part of material culture and ethical guidelines for technology utilization are viewed as an adaptive aspect of non-material culture. Cultural lag is seen as a critical ethical issue because failure to develop broad social consensus on appropriate applications of modern technology may lead to breakdowns in social solidarity and the rise of social conflict. Reasons for cultural lag between technology and ethics include the social structural and market conditions under which each are developed. The thesis is illustrated by reviews of technological trends involving computer-telecommunications electronics and bio- genetic engineering, and the implications of these and other technologies for privacy rights, electronic commerce, control of essential resources and social definitions of life are discussed.},

To date, research has focused on how to increase the sustainability of packaging through the use of eco-design tools, and there has been only limited investigation of the relationship between sustainable packaging and consumer behavior during the purchase and recycling stages of the packaging life cycle. The present study examines the factors that influence consumers' product purchasing behavior and their recycling behavior with respect to sustainable packaging. Data from an online survey of 215 respondents in Portugal was used to test several hypotheses by comparing two groups of consumers: one group that places importance on environmentally friendly packaging and another that regards such packaging as unimportant in product purchase decisions. The results obtained show that gender, environmental awareness, concerns about societal opinions, a positive attitude towards green purchasing, and the perception of consumer actions are factors that differentiate the two groups of consumers. The findings should prove of use to public decision-makers, companies producing packaging, and marketers. However, features such as price are still needed to alter the behavior of consumers with respect to encouraging the use of sustainable packaging. In the near future, the study should be spread to a national scale to extend the findings of the present study, and to explore further aspects of consumer pro-environmental behavior with respect to sustainable packaging, including how the relationship between product and packaging may influence consumer behavior.},

In the framework of a biomimetic biology push process, we present the transfer of the functional movement principles of hollow tubular geometries that are surrounded by a net-like structure. Our plant models are the recent genera Ochroma (balsa) and Carica (papaya) as well as the fossil seed fern Lyginopteris oldhamia, which hold a net of macroscopic fiber structures enveloping the whole trunk. Asymmetries in these fiber nets, which are specifically caused by asymmetric growth of the secondary wood, enable the up-righting of inclined Ochroma and Carica stems. In a tubular net-like structure, the fiber angles play a crucial role in stress\textendash strain relationships. When braided tubes are subjected to internal pressure, they become shorter and thicker if the fiber angle is greater than 54.7\textdegree. However, if the fiber angle is less than 54.7\textdegree, they become longer and thinner. In this article, we use straightforward functional demonstrators to show how insights into functional principles from living nature can be transferred into plant-inspired actuators with linear or asymmetric deformation.},

Various approaches exist for inferring the correlation in the presence of estimation uncertainty and measurement error, but none are routinely applied in psychological research. Here we focus on a Bayesian hierarchical model proposed by Behseta, Berdyyeva, Olson, and Kass (2009) that allows researchers to infer the underlying correlation between error-contaminated observations. We show that this approach may be also applied to obtain the underlying correlation between uncertain parameter estimates as well as the correlation between uncertain parameter estimates and noisy observations. We illustrate the Bayesian modeling of correlations with two empirical data sets; in each data set, we first infer the posterior distribution of the underlying correlation and then compute Bayes factors to quantify the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an association.},

In sequential collaboration, one contributor creates an entry which is then consecutively encountered by other contributors who decide whether to adjust or maintain the presented entry. For numeric and geographical judgments, sequential collaboration yields improved judgments over the course of a sequential chain and results in accurate final estimates. We hypothesize that these benefits emerge since contributors adjust entries according to their expertise, implying that judgments of experts have a larger impact compared with those of novices. In three preregistered studies, we measured and manipulated expertise to investigate whether expertise leads to higher change probabilities and larger improvements in judgment accuracy. Moreover, we tested whether expertise results in an increase in accuracy over the course of a sequential chain. As expected, experts adjusted entries more frequently, made larger improvements, and contributed more to the final estimates of sequential chains. Overall, our findings suggest that the high accuracy of sequential collaboration is due to an implicit weighting of judgments by expertise.},

Model descriptions typically include only the explicit decisions and are silent on value judgments that may explain these decisions. Eliciting scientists' mental models, a systematic approach to determining how they think about climate risk management, can help to gain a clearer understanding of their modeling decisions. In order to identify and represent the role of values, beliefs and preferences on decisions, we used an augmented mental models research approach, namely values-informed mental models (ViMM). We conducted and qualitatively analyzed interviews with eleven climate risk management scientists. Our results suggest that these scientists use a similar decision framework to each other to think about modeling climate risk management tradeoffs, including eight specific decisions ranging from defining the model objectives to evaluating the model's results. The influence of values on these decisions varied between our scientists and between the specific decisions. For instance, scientists invoked ethical values (e.g., concerns about human welfare) when defining objectives, but epistemic values (e.g., concerns about model consistency) were more influential when evaluating model results. ViMM can (i) enable insights that can inform the design of new computational models and (ii) make value judgments explicit and more inclusive of relevant values. This transparency can help model users to better discern the relevance of model results to their own decision framing and concerns.},

Doubtful that large, complex series of events such as revolutions and social movements conform to general laws, they break events into smaller episodes, then identify recurrent mechanisms and proceses within them. Dynamics of Contention examines and compares eighteen contentious episodes drawn from many different parts of the world since the French Revolution, probing them for consequential and widely applicable mechanisms, for example, brokerage, category formation, and elite defection. The episodes range from nineteenth-century nationalist movements to contemporary Muslim-Hindu conflict to the Tiananmen crisis of 1989 to disintegration of the Soviet Union. The authors spell out the implications of their approach for explanation of revolutions, nationalism, and democratization, then lay out a more general program for study of contentious episodes wherever and whenever they occur.},

A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We first outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider definitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.},

  abstract = {The term ``climate emergency'' represents a new phase in climate change framing that many hope will invigorate more climate action. Yet there has been relatively little discussion of how the new emergency framing might shape broader governance and policy. In this advanced review, we critically review and synthesize existing literature on crisis and emergency to inform our understanding of how this new shift might affect governance and policy. Specifically, we explore the literature on crisis governance and policy to argue that there is no simple answer to whether the ``climate emergency'' framing will be supportive of climate governance and policy; rather, more work needs to be done to understand how different political actors respond according to their perceptions, interests and values. To assist this endeavor, we develop a typology of four policy pathways, ranging from ``no emergency,'' to ``no emergency, but recognize risk,'' ``emergency as a threat'' and ``emergency as an opportunity.'' We highlight the need to consider the effects of multiple and overlapping emergency frames, using the example of the intersection of climate change and COVID-19. Finally, we suggest new interdisciplinary research directions for critically analyzing and refining this new phase of climate change framing.

If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is to become an Essentialist. In Essentialism, Greg McKeown, CEO of a Leadership and Strategy agency in Silicon Valley who has run courses at Apple, Google and Facebook, shows you how to achieve what he calls the disciplined pursuit of less. Being an Essentialist is about a disciplined way of thinking. It means challenging the core assumption of `We can have it all' and `I have to do everything' and replacing it with the pursuit of `the right thing, in the right way, at the right time'.By applying a more selective criteria for what is essential, the pursuit of less allows us to regain control of our own choices so we can channel our time, energy and effort into making the highest possible contribution toward the goals and activities that matter. Using the experience and insight of working with the leaders of the most innovative companies and organisations in the world, McKeown shows you how to put Essentialism into practice in your own life, so you too can achieve something great.},

This paper describes and explores justice issues raised by participants in a series of deliberative public engagement meetings. Such justice issues included the distribution of costs and benefits across space and time; the relative power and influence of beneficiaries and others; and the weakness of procedural justice measures that might protect public interests in decision making about climate engineering. We argue that publics are mobilising diverse concepts of justice, echoing both philosophical and practical sources. We conclude that a better understanding of conceptions of justice in this context could assist exploration and understanding of public perceptions of and attitudes towards climate engineering and the different technologies involved. Such detailed public engagement would appear essential if sound, well-informed and morally justifiable decisions are to be made regarding research or development of climate engineering.},

  abstract = {In 1991, Jones developed an issue-contingent model of ethical decision making in which moral intensity is posited to affect the four stages of Rest's 1986 model (awareness, judgment, intention, and behavior). Jones claimed that moral intensity, which is ``the extent of issue-related moral imperative in a situation'' (p. 372), consists of six characteristics: magnitude of consequences (MC), social consensus (SC), probability of effect (PE), temporal immediacy (TI), proximity (PX), and concentration of effect (CE). This article reports the findings of two studies that analyzed the factor structure of moral intensity, operationalized by a 12-item Perceived Moral Intensity Scale (PMIS) adapted from the work of Singhapakdi et~al. [1996, Journal of Business Research, 36, 245\textendash 255] and Frey [2000, Journal of Business Ethics, 26, 181\textendash 195]. The two items that were purported to measure CE were dropped due to their inability to effectively tap into the characteristic proposed by Jones. Factor analyses of the remaining 10 items supported a 3-factor structure, with the MC, PE, and TI items loading on the first factor, the PX items loading on the second factor, and the SC items loading on the third factor. These factors were labeled: Probable Magnitude of Consequences, Proximity, and Social Consensus. The authors conclude that moral intensity consists of three characteristics, rather than the six posited by Jones.},

Both probable magnitude of consequences (a factor consisting of magnitude of consequences, probability of effect, and temporal immediacy) and social consensus had a significant effect; proximity did not. In the within-subject study manipulated moral intensity had a significant effect on ethical judgment, but perceived moral intensity did not. Regression of ethical judgment on age, gender, major, and the three perceived moral intensity factors was significant between-subjects, but not within-subject. Ethical judgment was found to be a more robust predictor of intention than perceived moral intensity using a within-subject design.},

Results of confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis failed to conclusively support the hypothesized 3- (short form) or 5-factor (long form) structure; both instruments were instead dominated by a general factor. Item response theory analyses using Samejima's (1969, Psychometrika Monograph Supplement34, (4, Pt. 2)) graded response model revealed that many items in the 30-item pool performed very well, and suggested that a different collection of items be used to form a short-form version of the MES. Our proposed 10-item instrument includes more discriminating items than the 8-item version, and has the added advantage of including two items from each of the five ethical philosophies represented in the original 30-item pool.},

Bioethics has made a mistake about its methods, and this has led not only to too much theorizing, but also fragmentation within bioethics. The unhelpful disputes between those who think bioethics needs to be more philosophical, more sociological, more clinical, or more empirical, continue. While each of these claims will have some point, they obscure what should be common to all instances of bioethics. Moreover, they provide another phantom that can lead newcomers to bioethics down blind alleyways stalked by bristling sociologists and philosophers. The method common to all bioethics is bringing moral reason to bear upon ethical issues, and it is more accurate and productive to clarify what this involves than to stake out a methodological patch that shows why one discipline is the most important. This book develops an account of the nature of bioethics and then explains how a number of methodological spectres have obstructed bioethics becoming what it should. In the final part, it explains how moral reason can be brought to bear upon practical issues via an 'empirical, Socratic' approach.--},

However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10\%\textendash 12\% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses. Recommendations include using identified rather than anonymous responses, incorporating instructed response items before data collection, as well as computing consistency indices and multivariate outlier analysis to ensure high-quality data.

In the summer of 1970, an international team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began a study of the implications of continued worldwide growth. They examined the five basic factors that determine and, in their interactions, ultimately limit growth on this planet-population increase, agricultural production, nonrenewable resource depletion, industrial output, and pollution generation. The MIT team fed data on these five factors into a global computer model and then tested the behavior of the model under several sets of assumptions to determine alternative patterns for mankind's future. The Limits to Growth is the nontechnical report of their findings. The book contains a message of hope, as well: Man can create a society in which he can live indefinitely on earth if he imposes limits on himself and his production of material goods to achieve a state of global equilibrium with population and production in carefully selected balance.},

Learning how to think in systems is now part of change-agent literacy. And this is the best book of its kind."--Hunter Lovins   In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growth--the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet--Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Thinking in Systems is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute's Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world--war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation--are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

There was strong support for allowing the study of SRM. Support decreased and uncertainty rose as subjects were asked about their support for using SRM immediately, or to stop a climate emergency. Support for SRM is associated with optimism about scientific research, a valuing of SRM's benefits and a stronger belief that SRM is natural, while opposition is associated with an attitude that nature should not be manipulated in this way. The potential risks of SRM are important drivers of public perception with the most salient being damage to the ozone layer and unknown risks. SRM is a new technology and public opinions are just forming; thus all reported results are sensitive to changes in framing, future information on risks and benefits, and changes to context.},

Analyzing experts' preferences for climate-policy options, we do not find a reduction of the mitigation budget, i.e. moral hazard, for RM or CDR experts compared to climate-change experts who are neither experts for RM nor for CDR. In particular, the budget shares earmarked for RM are low. The perceptions of risks and benefits of SAI are similar for RM and climate-change experts.

  abstract = {Injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere could quickly offset global warming caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Because the technology would have global side effects, it raises not only technological but also political, ethical, and social concerns. Therefore, research on sulfate injection should be accompanied by a global debate that incorporates public perceptions and concerns into the development and governance of the technology. Our paper provides insight into public perceptions and explores their underlying patterns using a survey conducted in Germany. The data reveal a differentiated picture. Laboratory research on sulfate injection is broadly approved, whereas field research is much less approved. Immediate deployment is largely rejected. The acceptance of the technology is associated with the belief that climate change is a serious problem and that humans will eventually be able to control nature. It is also determined by the levels of trust in scientists and firms. Among the strongest objections against the technology is the belief that humans should not manipulate nature in the way injecting sulfate would. The actual public perceptions of sulfate injection will, however, evolve along with the ongoing debate between the public, experts, and policymakers.},

As a new option in the bid to counter climate change, it has attracted an increasing amount of research and the debate on its potential gained momentum after it was referred to in the 5th IPCC assessment report (IPCC 2013). One major objection to SAI and the research done on it is that it could undermine commitment to the mitigation of greenhouse gases. Policymakers, interest groups or individuals might wrongly perceive SAI as an easy fix for climate change and accordingly reduce their mitigation efforts. This is the first study to provide an empirical evaluation of this claim for individuals. In a large-scale framed field experiment with more than 650 participants, we provide evidence that people do not back-pedal on mitigation when they are told that the climate change problem could be partly addressed via SAI. Instead, we observe that people who have been informed about SAI mitigate more than people who have not. Our data suggest that the increase is driven by a perception of SAI as potential threat.},

  abstract = {Over the past years, new options for addressing global warming and atmospheric CO2-concentrations - such as bioenergy carbon capture and storage - have been included in computer models that estimate how much more can be emitted before the global mean temperature increase surpasses 1.5\textdegree C. While the public in general remains mainly unaware of these, similar proposals in the past have triggered public protests. The prospect of public opposition therefore calls into question the use of these options in the models. Even if societies decarbonized rapidly, it is unlikely that they will achieve the 1.5\textdegree C target without also resorting to CO2 removal, by means, for example, of bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Such methods were included in the special report Global Warming of 1.5\textdegree C published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2018. This report also discusses solar radiation management, such as stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) which might be used to change global temperatures. However, public debate about the acceptability of these methods remains absent. We look at laypersons' perceptions of BECCS and SAI at three stylized stages of increasing knowledge and deliberation. We found a high level of uncertainty among survey respondents as to whether to accept the use of these methods, which decreases when additional information is supplied by stakeholders. When comparing survey participants to members of a citizens' jury, we found lower levels of acceptance for SAI and similar levels for BECCS among jury members who had deliberated the methods intensively. Despite fears of distracting from the aim of reducing emissions, decision-makers should publicly discuss these methods to avoid planning based on incorrect assumptions about the political feasibility of CO2 removal. People want to be informed about both approaches and the threat of SAI makes them focus their attention on mitigation.},

This view is fragmented and incomplete, especially because it fails to take into account both evidence of the value implications of score meaning as a basis for action and the social consequences of score use. The new unified concept of validity interrelates these issues as fundamental aspects of a more comprehensive theory of construct validity that addresses both score meaning and social values in test interpretation and test use. That is, unified validity integrates considerations of content, criteria, and consequences into a construct framework for the empirical testing of rational hypotheses about score meaning and theoretically relevant relationships, including those of an applied and a scientific nature. Six distinguishable aspects of construct validity are highlighted as a means of addressing central issues implicit in the notion of validity as a unified concept. These are content, substantive, structural, generalizability, external, and consequential aspects of construct validity. In effect, these six aspects function as general validity criteria or standards for all educational and psychological measurement, including performance assessments, which are discussed in some detail because of their increasing emphasis in educational and employment settings.

  abstract = {This dissertation explores the role of cognition\textemdash the elements, structures and processes of individual and collective thought\textemdash in finding effective, cooperative solutions to climate change. It makes three contributions\textemdash theoretical, empirical, and methodological\textemdash to international relations scholarship. First, it explores cognition as a significant variable in international political life, developing an analytical framework that not only links a cognitive framework of analysis to major IR theories but bridges current theoretical divides between rationalism and constructivism. Second, by identifying and visualizing current belief systems of participants in global climate negotiations, the thesis offers insights regarding cognitive obstacles to multilateral cooperation. The most important obstacle is a clash of substantively and emotionally different belief systems. Depending on the specific constellation of a person's beliefs about collective identity, perceptions of climate-change threat, and associated emotions, some belief systems contain normative beliefs about justice (i.e., a dominant logic of appropriateness), while others do not. The latter belief systems reflect the national-interest logic of consequences. Focusing in particular on the ``wicked'' characteristics of climate change, the analysis further reveals a neglect of scientific knowledge (in particular knowledge of the possibility of climate tipping points), a serious under-valuation of the distant future, and perceptions of a number of constraints on agency, some of which cannot be resolved within the negotiations. The study also identifies six distinct belief systems among climate negotiators, which I label The International Community, A Minilateral Club, The Market, Individuals, The Developed World, and The Irresponsible West. The key element distinguishing these belief systems is actor type, which affects problem definitions, proposed solutions, political strategies, and more generally an actor's role in global climate governance. Third, this dissertation expands the methodological toolbox available to IR scholars by demonstrating the value and synergistic power of cognitive-affective mapping and Q Method. These are powerful tools to reveal individual and collective belief systems respectively.},

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement has opened debate on whether limiting warming to 1.5\,\textdegree C is compatible with current emission pledges and warming of about 0.9\,\textdegree C from the mid-nineteenth century to the present decade. We show that limiting cumulative post-2015 CO2 emissions to about 200\,GtC would limit post-2015 warming to less than 0.6\,\textdegree C in 66\% of Earth system model members of the CMIP5 ensemble with no mitigation of other climate drivers. We combine a simple climate\textendash carbon-cycle model with estimated ranges for key climate system properties from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Assuming emissions peak and decline to below current levels by 2030, and continue thereafter on a much steeper decline, which would be historically unprecedented but consistent with a standard ambitious mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), results in a likely range of peak warming of 1.2\textendash 2.0\,\textdegree C above the mid-nineteenth century. If CO2 emissions are continuously adjusted over time to limit 2100 warming to 1.5\,\textdegree C, with ambitious non-CO2 mitigation, net future cumulative CO2 emissions are unlikely to prove less than 250\,GtC and unlikely greater than 540\,GtC. Hence, limiting warming to 1.5\,\textdegree C is not yet a geophysical impossibility, but is likely to require delivery on strengthened pledges for 2030 followed by challengingly deep and rapid mitigation. Strengthening near-term emissions reductions would hedge against a high climate response or subsequent reduction rates proving economically, technically or politically unfeasible.},

  abstract = {Empirical research into the ethics of emerging technologies, often involving foresight studies, technology assessment or application of the precautionary principle, raises significant epistemological challenges by failing to explain the relative epistemic status of contentious normative claims about future states. This weakness means that it is unclear why the conclusions reached by these approaches should be considered valid, for example in anticipatory ethical assessment or governance of emerging technologies. This paper explains and responds to this problem by proposing an account of how the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims can be established in ethical and political discourses based on J\"urgen Habermas' discourse ethics. To better understand the nature of the problem, the relationship between norms, facts and the future is explored in light of potential meta-ethical fallacies faced in the field of empirical ethics. Weaknesses of current approaches to anticipatory ethical assessment and governance are then explored, including the Precautionary Principle and Technology Assessment. We argue that the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims can be understood within Habermas' approach to political discourse, which requires `translation' of uncertain claims to be comprehensible to other stakeholders in discourse. Translation thus provides a way to allow for uncertain normative claims to be considered alongside other types of validity claims in discourse. The paper contributes a conceptual account of the epistemic status of uncertain normative claims in discourse and begins to develop a `methodology of translation' which can be further developed for approaches to research and ethical assessment supporting anticipatory evidence-based policy, governance and system design.},

Instead of instructing participants to randomly switch between tasks, as in the classic voluntary task-switching paradigm (Arrington \& Logan, 2004), we instructed participants to optimize their task performance in a voluntary task-switching environment in which the stimulus associated with the previously selected task appeared in each trial after a delay. Importantly, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) increased further with each additional repetition of this task, whereas the stimulus needed for a task switch was always immediately available. We conducted two experiments with different SOA increments (i.e., Exp. 1a = 50 ms, Exp. 1b = 33 ms) to see whether this procedure would induce switching behavior, and we explored how people trade off switch costs against the increasing availability of the stimulus needed for a task repetition. We observed that participants adapted their behavior to the different task environments (i.e., SOA increments) and that participants switched tasks when the SOA in task switches approximately matched the switch costs. Moreover, correlational analyses indicated relations between individual switch costs and individual switch rates across participants. Together, these results demonstrate that participants were sensitive to the increased availability of switch stimuli in deciding whether to switch or to repeat, which in turn demonstrates flexible adaptive task selection behavior. We suggest that performance limitations in task switching interact with the task environment to influence switching behavior.},

The developed world is now suffering from another bout of such angst.  Anxieties over technology can take on several forms, and we focus on three of the most prominent concerns.  First, there is the concern that technological progress will cause widespread substitution of machines for labor, which in turn could lead to technological unemployment and a further increase in inequality in the short run, even if the long-run effects are beneficial.  Second, there has been anxiety over the moral implications of technological process for human welfare, broadly defined.  While, during the Industrial Revolution, the worry was about the dehumanizing effects of work, in modern times, perhaps the greater fear is a world where the elimination of work itself is the source of dehumanization.  A third concern cuts in the opposite direction, suggesting that the epoch of major technological progress is behind us.  Understanding the history of technological anxiety provides perspective on whether this time is truly different.  We consider the role of these three anxieties among economists, primarily focusing on the historical period from the late 18th to the early 20th century, and then compare the historical and current manifestations of these three concerns.},

The table consists of eight columns: ``view on distinction descriptive-prescriptive sciences,'' ``location of moral authority,'' ``central goal(s),'' ``types of normativity,'' ``use of empirical data,'' ``method,'' ``interaction empirical data and moral theory,'' and ``cooperation with descriptive sciences.'' Ethicists can use the table in order to identify their own approach. Reflection on these issues prior to starting research in empirical ethics should lead to harmonization of the different scientific disciplines and effective planning of the final research design. Integrated empirical ethics (IEE) refers to studies in which ethicists and descriptive scientists cooperate together continuously and intensively. Both disciplines try to integrate moral theory and empirical data in order to reach a normative conclusion with respect to a specific social practice. IEE is not wholly prescriptive or wholly descriptive since IEE assumes an interdepence between facts and values and between the empirical and the normative. The paper ends with three suggestions for consideration on some of the future challenges of integrated empirical ethics.},

This paper proposes a new tiered approach to technology assessment at low Technology Readiness Levels that enables a both rapid and concerted interdisciplinary science response to this Great Acceleration. Covering sustainability, ethics, and consumer issues, this approach encourages and enables the innovators themselves to conduct assessments embedded in the innovation process as early as possible. Suitable tools for early engagement that help facilitate development-integrated assessments are introduced and described. The design and use of these instruments in the field of basic research is illustrated using the Cluster of Excellence livMatS as an example.In einer \"Ara immer rascherer und folgenreicherer technologischer Entwicklungen laufen sowohl die Technologiebewertung als auch transdisziplin\"are Interventionen Gefahr, strukturell hinter der Dynamik von Innovationen zur\"uckzubleiben.

Both the rapid development as well as the depth of intervention of new technologies result in far-reaching and irreversible anthropogenic changes in the Earth's natural system.

Against this background, this review article aims to compile the current state of knowledge with regard to the early sustainability assessment of technologies and to classify this status quo with respect to the key challenges of the Anthropocene. To that end, the paper initially outlines major existing definitions and framings of the term of sustainability. Key milestones, concepts and instruments with regard to the development of sustainability assessment and technology assessment (TA) methodologies are also presented. Based on this overview, the energy sector is used as an example to discuss how mirroring ongoing transformation processes can contribute to the further development of the TA framework in order to ensure an agile, goal-oriented, and future-proof assessment system.},

To answer novel questions in the Anthropocene context, scientists have established relevant approaches to collaborate at an interdisciplinary level and have entered into exchange with society in the sense of transdisciplinary activities. With regard to biomimetics, we introduce the interdisciplinary approaches and transdisciplinary contributions leading to the development of biomimetic products on the market. Regarding sustainability research, we focus on a prospective assessment of substances of very high concern and show how environmental, economic, social, and ethical issues as well as policy measures play a central role in chemicals risk management. In the final ``practice bridge'' section, we use examples to describe how biomimetics and sustainability research can meet and how biomimetic products can contribute to sustainable development in the Anthropocene.},

The coexistence of popular evergreens with novel and sometimes ephemeral trends pervades technological, scientific and artistic production. Though this phenomenon is very intuitively captured by our common sense, a comprehensive explanation of how waves of novelties are not hampered by well established old-comers is still lacking. Here we first quantify this phenomenology by empirically looking at different systems that display innovation at very different levels: the creation of hashtags in Twitter, the evolution of online code repositories, the creation of texts and the listening of songs on online platforms. In all these systems surprisingly similar patterns emerge as the non-trivial outcome of two contrasting forces: the tendency of retracing already explored avenues (exploit) and the inclination to explore new possibilities. These findings are naturally explained in the framework of the expansion of the adjacent possible, a recently introduced theoretical framework that postulates the restructuring of the space of possibilities conditional to the occurrence of innovations. The predictions of our theoretical framework are borne out in all the phenomenologies investigated, paving the way to a better understanding and control of innovation processes.},

The authors analyze the structure of semantic networks that they sampled from individuals through a new snowball sampling paradigm during approximately 6 weeks of 1-hr daily sessions. The semantic networks of individuals have a small-world structure with short distances between words and high clustering. The distribution of links follows a power law truncated by an exponential cutoff, meaning that most words are poorly connected and a minority of words has a high, although bounded, number of connections. Existing aggregate networks mirror the individual link distributions, and so they are not scale-free, as has been previously assumed; still, there are properties of individual structure that the aggregate networks do not reflect. A simulation of the new sampling process suggests that it can uncover the true structure of an individual's semantic memory.},

Here, we harmonize worldwide litter-type inventories across seven major aquatic environments and find that a set of plastic items from take-out food and beverages largely dominates global litter, followed by those resulting from fishing activities. Compositional differences between environments point to a trend for litter to be trapped in nearshore areas so that land-sourced plastic is released to the open ocean, predominantly as small plastic fragments. The world differences in the composition of the nearshore litter sink reflected socioeconomic drivers, with a reduced relative weight of single-use items in high-income countries. Overall, this study helps inform urgently needed actions to manage the production, use and fate of the most polluting human-made items on our planet, but the challenge remains substantial.},

On the most general level, there is a basic consensus that many judgments, including ethical judgments, are made by intuitive, even unconscious, impulses. This basic insight has opened the door to a wide variety of more particular studies that investigate how judgments are influenced by group identity, self-conception, emotions, perceptions of risk, and many other factors. When these forms of research engage ethical issues, they are sometimes called empirical ethics. This essay argues that the field of religious ethics would benefit from a more robust engagement with empirical ethics than it has thus far undertaken. In doing so, it offers a brief account of how issues of moral psychology and moral anthropology have been treated in religious ethics, and it highlights ways that the scientific findings challenge some prevailing norms in religious ethics. It ends by suggesting avenues by which religious ethics research could productively engage empirical ethics.},

Most of the literature on this so-called `moral hazard' problem focuses on the prediction that climate engineering research would reduce mitigation efforts. This paper focuses on a related ethical question: Why would it be a bad thing if climate engineering research obstructed mitigation? If climate engineering promises to be effective enough, it might justify some reduction in mitigation. Climate policy portfolios involving sufficiently large or poorly planned reductions in mitigation, however, could lead to an outcome that would be worse than the portfolio that would be chosen in the absence of further climate engineering research. This paper applies three ethical perspectives to describe the kinds of portfolios that would be worse than that `baseline portfolio'. The literature on climate engineering identifies various mechanisms that might cause policy-makers to choose these inferior portfolios, but it is difficult to know in advance whether the existence of these mechanisms means that climate engineering research really would lead to a worse outcome. In the light of that uncertainty, a precautionary approach suggests that researchers should take measures to reduce the risk of mitigation obstruction. Several such measures are suggested.},

However, a number of previous studies found that statistical power to reject a misspecified model increases and descriptive fit-indices deteriorate when loadings are high, thereby inappropriately panelizing high reliability indicators. Based on both theoretical considerations and empirical simulation studies, we show that previous results only hold for a particular definition and a particular type of model error. At a constant degree of misspecification (as measured through the minimum of the fit-function), statistical power to reject a wrong model and noncentrality based fit-indices (such as the root-mean squared error of approximation; RMSEA) are independent of loading magnitude. If the degree of model error is controlled through the average residuals, higher loadings are associated with increased statistical power and a higher RMSEA when the measurement model is misspecified, but with decreased power and a lower RMSEA when the structural model is misspecified. In effect, inconsistencies among noncentrality and residual based fit-indices can provide information about possible sources of misfit that would be obscured when considering either measure in isolation.

Herein, we provide a unifying, comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding dark personality in terms of a general dispositional tendency of which dark traits arise as specific manifestations. That is, we theoretically specify the common core of dark traits, which we call the Dark Factor of Personality (D). The fluid concept of D captures individual differences in the tendency to maximize one's individual utility\textemdash disregarding, accepting, or malevolently provoking disutility for others\textemdash accompanied by beliefs that serve as justifications. To critically test D, we unify and extend prior work methodologically and empirically by considering a large number of dark traits simultaneously, using statistical approaches tailored to capture both the common core and the unique content of dark traits, and testing the predictive validity of both D and the unique content of dark traits with respect to diverse criteria including fully consequential and incentive-compatible behavior. In a series of four studies (N {$>$} 2,500), we provide evidence in support of the theoretical conceptualization of D, show that dark traits can be understood as specific manifestations of D, demonstrate that D predicts a multitude of criteria in the realm of ethically, morally, and socially questionable behavior, and illustrate that D does not depend on any particular indicator variable included.

Results show that all HEXACO-PI(-R) versions exhibit fairly high reliabilities and a high degree of self\textendash observer agreement. With the exception of a moderate correlation between Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness, the HEXACO dimensions are only weakly correlated overall. Finally, notable gender differences (with women scoring higher) occurred on Emotionality and Honesty-Humility. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

The survey was on the dental hygiene habits of Chinese college students.         Results:~         Whereas only 35\% of men and 10\% of women admitted to insufficient dental hygiene when questioned directly, 51\% of men and 20\% of women attested to this socially undesirable behavior in a randomized-response survey.

The traditional method of establishing these scenarios was a time-consuming sequential process, each discipline taking turns to add data and complexity. As Richard Moss and colleagues explain in a Perspectives review, climate change researchers have now established a new coordinated parallel process that integrates the tasks of developing scenarios, making projections and evaluating their impact. These 'next generation' scenarios should make for faster, more rigorous assessment of proposals for climate mitigation and adaptation.},

This attempt required addressing difficulties associated with pinpointing relevant literature, most notably the varied nomenclature used to refer to ethical judgments (individual evaluations of actions' ethicality). Given this variation in construct nomenclature and the difficulties it presented in identifying pertinent focal studies, we elected to focus on research that cited papers featuring prominent and often-used measures of ethical judgments (primarily, but not exclusively, the Multidimensional Ethics Scale). Our review of these studies indicated a preponderance of inferences and conclusions unwarranted by empirical evidence (likely attributable at least partly to inconsistent nomenclature). Moreover, ethical judgments related consistently to few respondent characteristics or any other variables, emergent relationships may not always be especially meaningful, and much research seems inclined to repetition of already verified findings. Although we concluded that knowledge about ethical judgments seems not to have advanced appreciably after decades of investigation, we suggested a possible path forward that focuses on the content of what is actually being judged as reflected in the myriad of vignettes used in the literature to elicit judgments.},

  abstract = {In Ethics Position Theory, relativism is the degree to which people believe that universal moral rules should not always be applied unwaveringly. Researchers often predict that highly relativistic individuals are characterized by questionable ethics given their ostensible self-interested ``anything goes'' approach. Corroborating evidence for such predictions, however, remains elusive. This paper suggested that high relativists are perhaps not unethical, and reviewed four decades of relevant literature in order to clarify the meaning and implications of the relativism construct. The portrait of relativism that emerged is often contrary to prevalent expectations. Relativistic individuals seem tolerant of ambiguity, open to experience, non-authoritarian, accepting of others with different backgrounds and lifestyles, and troubled by injustice. No persuasive evidence of questionable ethics is available. These findings have profound implications for managerial practice and suggest that highly relativistic employees may be among the most valuable. Future research grounded in an understanding of what relativism is rather than what it should be has the potential to allow a deeper understanding of this important construct to emerge. We also explore possible reasons why an inaccurate narrative about relativistic orientations may have emerged and persisted among both researchers and people generally.},

  abstract = {In times of accelerating earth system transformations and their potentially disruptive societal consequences, imagining and governing the future is now a core challenge for sustainability research and practice. Much social science and sustainability science scholarship increasingly engages with the future. There is, however, a lack of scrutiny of how the future is envisioned in these literatures, and with what implications for governance in the present. This article analyses these two aspects, building on the concept of ``anticipatory governance.'' We understand anticipatory governance to broadly mean governing in the present to adapt to or shape uncertain futures. We review perspectives within public policy, futures studies, social\textendash ecological systems, environmental policy and governance, transition studies, science and technology studies, and responsible research and innovation literatures. All these literatures engage explicitly or implicitly with the notion of anticipatory governance, yet from distinct ontological and epistemological starting points. Through our review, we identify four approaches to anticipatory governance that differ with regard to (a) their conceptions of and engagement with the future; (b) their implications for actions to be taken in the present; and (c) the ultimate end to be realized through anticipatory governance. We then map onto these four approaches a diverse set of methods and tools of anticipation that each engages with. In concluding, we discuss how these four approaches provide a useful analytical lens through which to assess ongoing practices of anticipatory governance in the climate and sustainability realm.

The purpose of this article is to clearly describe the differences in indications between scoping reviews and systematic reviews and to provide guidance for when a scoping review is (and is not) appropriate. Results Researchers may conduct scoping reviews instead of systematic reviews where the purpose of the review is to identify knowledge gaps, scope a body of literature, clarify concepts or to investigate research conduct. While useful in their own right, scoping reviews may also be helpful precursors to systematic reviews and can be used to confirm the relevance of inclusion criteria and potential questions. Conclusions Scoping reviews are a useful tool in the ever increasing arsenal of evidence synthesis approaches. Although conducted for different purposes compared to systematic reviews, scoping reviews still require rigorous and transparent methods in their conduct to ensure that the results are trustworthy. Our hope is that with clear guidance available regarding whether to conduct a scoping review or a systematic review, there will be less scoping reviews being performed for inappropriate indications better served by a systematic review, and vice-versa.},

Yet like other phenomenologically simple cognitive processes such as walking or understanding speech, concept formation and use are maddeningly complex.Research since the 1970s and the decline of the "classical view" of concepts have greatly illuminated the psychology of concepts. But persistent theoretical disputes have sometimes obscured this progress. The Big Book of Concepts goes beyond those disputes to reveal the advances that have been made, focusing on the major empirical discoveries. By reviewing and evaluating research on diverse topics such as category learning, word meaning, conceptual development in infants and children, and the basic level of categorization, the book develops a much broader range of criteria than is usual for evaluating theories of concepts.},

  abstract = {In medical ethics, business ethics, and some branches of political philosophy (multi-culturalism, issues of just allocation, and equitable distribution) the literature increasingly combines insights from ethics and the social sciences. Some authors in medical ethics even speak of a new phase in the history of ethics, hailing ``empirical ethics'' as a logical next step in the development of practical ethics after the turn to ``applied ethics.'' The name empirical ethics is ill-chosen because of its associations with ``descriptive ethics.'' Unlike descriptive ethics, however, empirical ethics aims to be both descriptive and normative. The first question on which I focus is what kind of empirical research is used by empirical ethics and for which purposes. I argue that the ultimate aim of all empirical ethics is to improve the context-sensitivity of ethics. The second question is whether empirical ethics is essentially connected with specific positions in meta-ethics. I show that in some kinds of meta-ethical theories, which I categorize as broad contextualist theories, there is an intrinsic need for connecting normative ethics with empirical social research. But context-sensitivity is a goal that can be aimed for from any meta-ethical position.},

This systematic review seeks to estimate people's attitudes toward, trust in, anxiety associated with, and acceptance of social robots; as well as factors that are associated with these beliefs. Ninety-seven studies were identified with a combined sample of over 13,000 participants and a standardized score was computed for each in order to represent the valence (positive, negative, or neutral) and magnitude (on a scale from 1 to -\,1) of people's beliefs about robots. Potential moderating factors such as the robots' domain of application and design, the type of exposure to the robot, and the characteristics of potential users were also investigated. The findings suggest that people generally have positive attitudes towards social robots and are willing to interact with them. This finding may challenge some of the existing doubt surrounding the adoption of robotics in social domains of application but more research is needed to fully understand the factors that influence attitudes.},

  abstract = {The growing problem of changing environmental conditions caused by climate destabilization is well recognized as one of the defining issues of our time. The root problem is greenhouse gas emissions, and the fundamental solution is curbing those emissions. Climate geoengineering has often been considered to be a "last-ditch" response to climate change, to be used only if climate change damage should produce extreme hardship. Although the likelihood of eventually needing to resort to these efforts grows with every year of inaction on emissions control, there is a lack of information on these ways of potentially intervening in the climate system. As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention discusses albedo modification - changing the fraction of incoming solar radiation that reaches the surface. This approach would deliberately modify the energy budget of Earth to produce a cooling designed to compensate for some of the effects of warming associated with greenhouse gas increases. The prospect of large-scale albedo modification raises political and governance issues at national and global levels, as well as ethical concerns. Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth discusses some of the social, political, and legal issues surrounding these proposed techniques. It is far easier to modify Earth's albedo than to determine whether it should be done or what the consequences might be of such an action. One serious concern is that such an action could be unilaterally undertaken by a small nation or smaller entity for its own benefit without international sanction and regardless of international consequences. Transparency in discussing this subject is critical. In the spirit of that transparency, Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth was based on peer-reviewed literature and the judgments of the authoring committee; no new research was done as part of this study and all data and information used are from entirely open sources. By helping to bring light to this topic area, this book will help leaders to be far more knowledgeable about the consequences of albedo modification approaches before they face a decision whether or not to use them.},

The Es are developed for several variations of classical test theory and autocorrelation models. Es based on the general concept of regression are seen not only to depart from those depicted in the psychometric lore but to vary considerably from one underlying model to another, particularly when moving from the 2-occasion to a multiple-occasion measurement framework. Regression toward the mean is not a ubiquitous phenomenon, nor does it always continue across occasions. It is necessary to specify the characteristics of model assumptions to understand the when, how, and extent of regression toward the mean. Past interpretations have been incomplete and to an extent incorrect because they focused largely on a limited circumstance: 2-occasions of measurement and simplexlike correlation matrices.

People deem robots more competent and receive higher capacity trust when they perform analytical tasks compared to social tasks, independent of the robot's gender. An observed trend in the data implies a tendency to dehumanize robots as an effect of their gendered appearance, sometimes as an interaction effect with performed task when this contradicts gender stereotypical expectations. Our results stress further exploration of robot gender by varying gender cues and considering alternative task descriptions, as well as highlight potential new directions in studying human misconduct towards robots.},

This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.},

  publisher = {{Routledge}},
  abstract = {This comprehensive resource reviews structural equation modeling (SEM) strategies for longitudinal data to help readers see which modeling options are available for which hypotheses. The author demonstrates how SEM is related to other longitudinal data techniques throughout. By exploring connections between models, readers gain a better understanding of when to choose one analysis over another. The book explores basic models to sophisticated ones including the statistical and conceptual underpinnings that are the building blocks of the analyses. Accessibly written, research examples from the behavioral and social sciences and results interpretations are provided throughout. The emphasis is on concepts and practical guidance for applied research rather than on mathematical proofs. New terms are highlighted and defined in the glossary. Figures are included for every model along with detailed discussions of model specification and implementation issues. Each chapter also includes examples of each model type, comment sections that provide practical guidance, model extensions, and recommended readings.   Highlights include:   Covers the major SEM approaches to longitudinal analysis in one resource.    Explores connections between longitudinal SEM models to enhance integration.    Numerous examples that help readers match research questions to appropriate analyses and interpret results.   Reviews practical issues related to model specification and estimation to reinforce connections.    Analyzes continuous and discrete (binary and ordinal) variables throughout for breadth not found in other sources.   Reviews key SEM concepts for those who need a refresher (Ch. 1).    Emphasizes how to apply and interpret each model through realistic data examples.     Provides the book's data sets at www.longitudinalsem.com along with the Mplus and R-lavaan syntax used to generate the results.   Introduces the LISREL notation system used throughout (Appendix A).    The chapters can be read out of order but it is best to read chapters 1 \textendash{} 4 first because most of the later chapters refer back to them. The book opens with a review of latent variables and analysis of binary and ordinal variables. Chapter 2 applies this information to assessing longitudinal measurement invariance. SEM tests of dependent means and proportions over time points are explored in Chapter 3, and stability and change, difference scores, and lagged regression are covered in Chapter 4. The remaining chapters are each devoted to one major type of longitudinal SEM -- repeated measures analysis models, full cross-lagged panel models and simplex models, modeling stability with state-trait models, linear and nonlinear growth curve models, latent difference score models, latent transition analysis, time series analysis, survival analysis, and attrition. Missing data is discussed in the context of many of the preceding models in Chapter 13.   Ideal for graduate courses on longitudinal (data) analysis, advanced SEM, longitudinal SEM, and/or advanced data (quantitative) analysis taught in the behavioral, social, and health sciences, this text also appeals to researchers in these fields. Intended for those without an extensive math background, prerequisites include familiarity with basic SEM. Matrix algebra is avoided in all but a few places.},

  abstract = {Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental consequences of packaging. Businesses are under pressure not only from consumers but also from governments to use eco-friendly packaging for their products. However, what consumers perceive to be eco-friendly packaging is still unclear, especially in emerging markets. This study examines consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging in the context of packaged food products of Vietnam. The study involved a series of six focus group discussions conducted with a diverse range of consumers. The focus of the discussion was consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging, particularly whether or not consumers would adjust their purchase behaviours to be more environmentally friendly. The data analysis procedure was undertaken using inductive manual coding principles associated with interpretivist research. The results indicate that consumer perceptions of eco-friendly packaging can be categorised along three key dimensions: packaging materials, manufacturing technology and market appeal. While consumers have diverse perceptions of eco-friendly packaging, their knowledge is limited and more related to packaging materials (such as biodegradability and recyclability), and market appeal (such as attractive graphic design and good price). Consumers show little knowledge about manufacturing technologies but still desire an eco-friendly manufacturing process. Results also suggest that a consumer-defined eco-friendly package for food products should be visually appealing while satisfying consumers' environmental expectations relating to packaging materials and manufacturing process. We therefore propose a consumer-initiated development of eco-friendly packaging that can be applied for sustainable packaging strategies.},

Confirmatory factor analysis on a sample of 300 undergraduate business students showed that a model with three latent variables representing three correlated ethical dimensions of moral equity, relativism, and contractualism, three correlated scenario latent variables, and correlated residuals presented a good fit to the data. Further, structural models of the relationship of ethical judgment to behavioral intentions revealed that behavioral intentions were more highly related to the scenario factors than to the ethical dimensions across three scenarios. Adding a method factor to the model improved goodness-of-fit and changed some structural model conclusions.},

  abstract = {The stringency of the 1.5 degree goal under the Paris Agreement, coupled with the mismatch between that goal and domestic mitigation pledges, inevitably directs attention onto the potential future role of solar radiation management (SRM) technologies. Such technologies, however, remain controversial, and analysis of their environmental, social and ethical implications is at an early stage. In this context, this paper distils four key governance objectives and proposes three specific policy interventions for the near-term governance of SRM technologies. Specifically, we build from existing literature to argue that SRM governance must simultaneously: guard against the risks of uncontrolled SRM development; enable potentially valuable research; build legitimacy for research and any future policy through broad public engagement and ensure that SRM is only considered as one part of a broader mitigation agenda. We propose three interventions to work towards those objectives in the near term by: developing a transparency mechanism for research; creating a global forum for public engagement and including consideration of SRM in the global stocktake under the Paris Agreement. Finally, we argue that carrying out these interventions requires a shared or `polycentric' SRM governance structure that can build on the site-specific capabilities and preferences of existing international institutions.Key policy insights Despite their highly controversial nature, large-scale technological interventions, such as solar radiation management (SRM), must be considered (albeit possibly rejected) for their potential contribution towards meeting the 1.5 degree target established under the Paris Agreement.Existing governance mechanisms for SRM need further development to ensure that unnecessary threats to social and/or natural systems are not incurred.There are at least three governance mechanisms that should be pursued immediately to protect against some of these potential threats, including: a transparency mechanism for SRM research, a global forum to facilitate public engagement and incorporating evaluation of SRM technologies into the global stocktake under the Paris Agreement.},

Creativity often requires interdisciplinary knowledge. 2. Immigrants often make important contributions to their new field. 3. Disciplinarians often commit errors which can be best detected by people familiar with two or more disciplines. 4. Some worthwhile topics of research fall in the interstices among the traditional disciplines. 5. Many intellectual, social, and practical problems require interdisciplinary approaches. 6. Interdisciplinary knowledge and research serve to remind us of the unity-of-knowledge ideal. 7. Interdisciplinarians enjoy greater flexibility in their research. 8. More so than narrow disciplinarians, interdisciplinarians often treat themselves to the intellectual equivalent of traveling in new lands. 9. Interdisciplinarians may help breach communication gaps in the modern academy, thereby helping to mobilize its enormous intellectual resources in the cause of greater social rationality and justice. 10. By bridging fragmented disciplines, interdisciplinarians might play a role in the defense of academic freedom. The case against interdisciplinary knowledge and research is made up of many intrinsic drawbacks and practical barriers. Taken together, these rewards, drawbacks, and barriers suggest a mild shift in the contemporary world of learning towards interdisciplinary knowledge and research.},

Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of models that can enhance and enrich the interaction between humans and robots.

Over the last several years, multiple models were proposed to face this open-challenge. This work provides a survey of the most relevant attempts/works. In details, it offers an overview of the architectures present in literature focusing on three specific aspects of HRI: the development of adaptive behavioral models, the design of cognitive architectures, and the ability to establish empathy with the user. The research was conducted within two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. Accurate exclusion criteria were applied to screen the 4916 articles found. At the end, 56 articles were selected. For each work, an evaluation of the model is made. Pros and cons of each work are detailed by analyzing the aspects that can be improved to establish an enjoyable interaction between robots and users.},

The paper concludes that pessimism and optimism may concern, for example, climate change as an unmitigated or poorly mitigated process, mitigation of climate change or specific measures of mitigation. These aspects are important to distinguish, because a person can be pessimist concerning climate change as an unmitigated or poorly mitigated process and optimist concerning mitigation of climate change, and be pessimist concerning one specific mitigation measure and optimist concerning another. It is suggested that the diversity of pessimistic and optimistic views is due to the uncertainty of scientific climate models and the influence of evaluative and ideological assumptions.},

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are approaches that integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework, and these are particularly important for climate change. One of the earliest IAMs for climate change was the DICE/RICE family of models, first published in Nordhaus (Science 258:1315\textendash 1319, 1992a), with the latest version in Nordhaus (2017, 2018). A difficulty in assessing IAMs is the inability to use standard statistical tests because of the lack of a probabilistic structure. In the absence of statistical tests, the present study examines the extent of revisions of the DICE model over its quarter-century history. The study finds that the major revisions have come primarily from the economic aspects of the model, whereas the environmental changes have been much smaller. Particularly, sharp revisions have occurred for global output, damages, and the social cost of carbon. These results indicate that the economic projections are the least precise parts of IAMs and deserve much greater study than has been the case up to now, especially careful studies of long-run economic growth (to 2100 and beyond). Additionally, the approach developed here can serve as a useful template for IAMs to describe their salient characteristics and revisions for the broader community of analysts.},

This study explores how social robotics may affect this situation. Using an online, video vignette-based experimental survey (n = 235), the study examines applicant fairness perceptions of two types of job interviews: a face-to-face and a robot-mediated interview. To reduce the risk of socially desirable responses, desensitize the topic, and detect any inconsistencies in the respondents' reactions to vignette scenarios, the study employs a first-person and a third-person perspective. In the robot-mediated interview, two teleoperated robots are used as fair proxies for the applicant and the interviewer, thus providing symmetrical visual anonymity unlike prior research that relied on asymmetrical anonymity, in which only one party was anonymized. This design is intended to eliminate visual cues that typically cause implicit biases and discrimination of applicants, but also to prevent biasing the interviewer's assessment through impression management tactics typically used by applicants. We hypothesize that fairness perception (i.e., procedural fairness and interactional fairness) and behavioral intentions (i.e., intentions of job acceptance, reapplication intentions, and recommendation intentions) will be higher in a robot-mediated job interview than in a face-to-face job interview, and that this effect will be stronger for introvert applicants. The study shows, contrary to our expectations, that the face-to-face interview is perceived as fairer, and that the applicant's personality (introvert vs. extravert) does not affect this perception. We discuss this finding and its implications, and address avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes\textemdash a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

Herman Kahn, the father of modern scenario planning, underlined the importance of ``thinking the unthinkable'' in a significant scenario study. ``Blessed with high intelligence, an assertive personality and the research capabilities of the RAND Corporation,'' he could rely on genius forecasting. But how can this foresight be creative as well as simultaneously credible and objective if one does not possess Kahn's genius? In this article, we assess the incorporation of expert knowledge via the Delphi technique into scenario planning as a promising option. We discuss possible combinations and identify the span of design alternatives in the existing body of Delphi-based scenario studies through a systematic research review and provide recommendations on how a Delphi-based scenario study should be designed to ensure quality. We recommend focusing on the integration of the Delphi technique only in one phase of the scenario approach. In this way, the design options can be intentionally adjusted to the particular function. We further offer recommendations on how to accomplish this.},

In addition, it allows for models that involve multiple latent class variables to be specified without each part of the model influencing the others. This article describes a unique latent transition analysis model where the measurement models are a latent class analysis model and a growth mixture model. We highlight the application of this model to study kindergarten readiness profiles and link it to elementary students' reading trajectories. Mplus syntax for the 3-step specification is provided.},

Given the increasing popularity of LCA, our aim is to equip psychological researchers with the theoretical and statistical fundamentals that we believe will facilitate the application of LCA models in practice. In this article, we provide answers to 10 frequently asked questions about LCA. The questions included in this article were fielded from our experience consulting with applied researchers interested in using LCA. The major topics include a general introduction in the LCA; an overview of class enumeration (e.g., deciding on the number of classes), including commonly used statistical fit indices; substantive interpretation of LCA solutions; estimation of covariates and distal outcome relations to the latent class variable; data requirements for LCA; software choices and considerations; distinctions and similarities among LCA and related latent variable models; and extensions of the LCA model. To illustrate the modeling ideas described in this article, we present an applied example using LCA. Specifically, we use LCA to model individual differences in positive youth development among college students and analyze demographic characteristics as covariates and a distal outcome of overall life satisfaction. We also include key references that direct readers to more detailed and technical discussions of these topics for which we provide an applied and introductory overview. We conclude by mentioning future developments in research and practice, including advanced cross-sectional and longitudinal extensions of LCA.

  abstract = {A worrying number of psychological findings are not replicable. Diagnoses of the causes of this "replication crisis," and recommendations to address it, have nearly exclusively focused on methods of data collection, analysis, and reporting. We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. We propose a distinction between discovery-oriented and theory-testing research. In discovery-oriented research, theories do not strongly imply hypotheses by which they can be tested, but rather define a search space for the discovery of effects that would support them. Failures to find these effects do not question the theory. This endeavor necessarily engenders a high risk of Type I errors-that is, publication of findings that will not replicate. Theory-testing research, by contrast, relies on theories that strongly imply hypotheses, such that disconfirmation of the hypothesis provides evidence against the theory. Theory-testing research engenders a smaller risk of Type I errors. A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models. We critically revisit recommendations for addressing the "replication crisis," including the proposal to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory research, and the preregistration of hypotheses and analysis plans.},

Study 2 replicated these findings (n = 10,707), contrasted the theoretically defined two-factor model to alternative models, and tested for invariance of factor covariances and mean structures for men and women. Study 3 examined the relationship between the EPQ and related indicators of ethical thought (values and moral foundations) and the theory's four-fold classification typology of exceptionists, subjectivists, absolutists, and situationists. The three studies substantially reduced the original EPQ's length, clarified the conceptual interpretation of the idealism and relativism scales, affirmed the EPQ's predictive and convergent validity, and supported the four-fold classification of individuals into ethics positions.

Yet ICR assessment can yield numerous benefits for qualitative studies, which include improving the systematicity, communicability, and transparency of the coding process; promoting reflexivity and dialogue within research teams; and helping convince diverse audiences of the trustworthiness of the analysis. Few guidelines exist to help researchers negotiate the assessment of ICR in qualitative analysis. The current article explains what ICR is, reviews common arguments for and against its incorporation in qualitative analysis and offers guidance on the practical elements of performing an ICR assessment.},

Instead, people may worry these videos are brainwashing others. That individuals believe other people will be more influenced by media messages than themselves is called third-person perception (TPP), and the consequences from those perceptions, such as calls for censorship, are called third-person effects (TPE). Here, we conduct three studies that examine the flat Earth phenomenon using TPP and TPE as a theoretical framework. We first measured participants' own perceptions of the convincingness of flat Earth arguments presented in YouTube videos and compared these to participants' perceptions of how convincing others might find the arguments. Instead of merely looking at ratings of one's self vs. a general `other,' however, we asked people to consider a variety of identity groups who differ based on political party, religiosity, educational attainment, and area of residence (e.g., rural, urban). We found that participants' religiosity and political party were the strongest predictors of TPP across the different identity groups. In our second and third pre-registered studies, we found support for our first study's conclusions, and we found mixed evidence for whether TPP predict support for censoring YouTube among the public.},

  abstract = {Although a growing body of research has debated the array of sustainability lessons of vernacular architecture, social sustainability discussions remain less advanced in comparison to the other pillars of sustainability. This has narrowed the plural lessons of vernacular architecture and limited the broad concept of sustainability to a partial one. Against this research gap, this study aims to conduct an assessment of the social sustainability of residential vernacular architecture through the application of a proposed Social Criteria of Green Building Assessment Tool (SCGBAT) assessment method. The SCGBAT proposes eight sets of social criteria categories namely; health and safety; participation and control; education; equity, accessibility and satisfaction; social cohesion; cultural values; physical resilience and also, 37 indicators for the evaluation of social sustainability. To empirically operationalize the proposed SCGBAT, this study utilizes the vernacular architecture typologies in the vernacular landscape of Louroujina village in Cyprus as a case study. Methods for data collection are desk review for secondary data while 135 close-ended questionnaires were used for primary data. The data are statistically presented based on Linkert scale and interpreted using both quantitative and descriptive analysis. The results demonstrated that the investigated vernacular architecture ranked lowly in Physical Resilience Indicator (PRI), Environmental Education Indicator (EEI), Accessibility and Satisfaction Indicator (ASI) but demonstrated sufficient lessons in the context of Health and Safety Indicator (HSI); Participation and Control Indicator (PCI); Social Equity Indicator (SEI); Social Cohesion Indicator (SCI); and Cultural Value Indicator (CVI). To this end, this paper contribute to the advancement of knowledge on the assessment of the social sustainability of vernacular architecture by innovatively applying a green building assessment approach and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of such approach in a vernacular setting.},

Moreover, it is possible that, once enrolled in these courses, students with high levels of statistics anxiety tend to procrastinate on assignments. Thus, the purpose of this study was: (a) to examine the prevalence of procrastination among graduate students, and (b) to investigate the relationship between academic procrastination and six dimensions of statistics anxiety. Participants were 135 graduate students enrolled in three sections of a required introductory-level educational research course at a university in the southeastern part of the USA. Findings revealed that a high percentage of students reported problems with procrastination on writing term papers, studying for examinations, and completing weekly reading assignments. A canonical correlation analysis (R c1 =.51) revealed that academic procrastination resulting from both fear of failure and task aversiveness was related significantly to worth of statistics, interpretation anxiety, test and class anxiety, computational self-concept, fear of asking for help, and fear of the statistics instructor. Implications for statistics anxiety reduction as a procrastination intervention are discussed.},

  abstract = {Food packaging maintains the food safety and ensures the quality of food throughout the supply chain. Both are achieved by the protective function of the packaging against negative ambient influences such as mechanical damage, light or water vapour. Material, form and concepts of packaging vary widely, which thus also differentiates the environmental impact for packaging. This paper provides an overview of the current research of European consumer perception and how this correlates with the environmental impact of loose foodstuffs and packaged food. Considered materials are plastic, glass, metal, and paper/cardboard. These perceptions are compared to the objective environmentally friendliness based on the selected assessment criteria carbon footprint, recycling rate, reuse rate and biological degradation/decomposition in Europe. The purpose of this paper is to discover whether there is any link between the consumer perception and the scientific assessed environmental sustainability. Consumers judge packaging material by criteria of circular economy, natural looking material, and design. The environmental impact of paper/cardboard and metal are rated in line with the scientific measure by consumers, whereas plastic packaging is underestimated and glass and biodegradable plastic packaging are highly overestimated. These results indicate that the rating of European consumers and scientific life cycle assessments turn out differently. The differences are mainly linked by theoretical concepts of recyclability, biodegradability, and reuse rate of the packaging. Consumers evaluate food packaging by affective feelings than using cognitive reasoning. Their knowledge about the practical implementation of recyclability, biodegradability and reusability as well as additional environmental impact factors are low. Consequently, consumers' buying behaviour is in most cases less environmentally sustainable than intended. Awareness trainings based on scientific facts, clear product and packaging information based on labelling schemes (``eco-labelling'') and nudging for sustainable behaviour can potentially support consumers in their sustainable buying behaviour.},

Data from social media might be one of the essential inputs for forecasting sales of vehicles. Besides, some other effects, such as stock market values, have influences on purchasing power of vehicles. In this paper, both multivariate regression models with social media data and stock market values and time series models are employed to predict monthly total vehicle sales. The least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) models are used to deal with multivariate regression data. Three types of data, namely sentiment scores of tweets, stock market values, and hybrid data, are employed in this paper to forecast monthly total vehicle sales in USA. The hybrid data contain both sentiment scores of tweets and stock market values. In addition, seasonal factors of monthly total vehicle sales are employed to deseasonalizing both monthly total vehicle sales and three types of input data. The time series models include the na\"ive model, the exponential smoothing model, the autoregressive integrated moving average model, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, and backpropagation neural networks and LSSVR with time series models. The numerical results indicate that using hybrid data with deseasonalizing procedures by the LSSVR models can obtain more accurate results than other models with different data. Thus, both social media data and stock values are essential to forecast monthly total vehicle sales; and deseasonalizing procedures can improve forecasting accuracy in predicting monthly total vehicle sales.},

  abstract = {Figural matrices tests are among the most popular and well-investigated tests used to assess inductive reasoning abilities. Solving these tests requires the selection of a target that completes a figural matrix among distractors. Despite their generally good psychometric properties, previous matrices tests have limitations associated with distractor construction that prevent them from realizing their full potential. Most tests allow participants to identify the correct response by eliminating distractors based on superficial features. The goal of this study was to develop a novel figural matrices test which is less prone to the use of response elimination strategies, and to test its psychometric properties. The new test consists of 48 items and was validated with N = 767 participants. Measurement models implied that the test is Rasch scalable, inferring a uniform underlying ability. The test showed good to very good reliability (retest-correlation: r = 0.88; Cronbach's alpha: {$\alpha$} = 0.93; split-half reliability: r = 0.88) and good construct validity (r = 0.81 with the Raven Progressive Matrices Test, r = 0.73 with global intelligence scores of the Intelligence Structure Test 2000R, and r = 0.58 with the global score of the Berlin Intelligence Structure Test). It even superseded the Raven Progressive Matrices Tests in criterion-related validity (correlation with final year high school grades (r = -0.49 p {$<$} .001)). We conclude that this novel test has excellent psychometric properties and can be a valuable tool for researchers interested in reasoning assessment.},

Ethical technology assessment will serve as a tool for identifying adverse effects of new technologies at an early stage. It should be undertaken in dialogue with technology developers and have the form of a continuous dialogue rather than a single evaluation at a specific point in time. eTA can be conducted on the basis of a check-list that refers to nine crucial ethical aspects of technology; (1) Dissemination and use of information, (2) Control, influence and power, (3) Impact on social contact patterns, (4) Privacy, (5) Sustainability, (6) Human reproduction, (7) Gender, minorities and justice, (8) International relations, and (9) Impact on human values.

Social media, such as Twitter, plays a significant role as a meaningful indicator in forecasting the Bitcoin (BTC) prices. However, there is a research gap in determining the optimal preprocessing strategy in BTC tweets to develop an accurate machine learning prediction model for bitcoin prices. This paper develops different text preprocessing strategies for correlating the sentiment scores of Twitter text with Bitcoin prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the effect of different preprocessing functions, features, and time lengths of data on the correlation results. Out of 13 strategies, we discover that splitting sentences, removing Twitter-specific tags, or their combination generally improve the correlation of sentiment scores and volume polarity scores with Bitcoin prices. The prices only correlate well with sentiment scores over shorter timespans. Selecting the optimum preprocessing strategy would prompt machine learning prediction models to achieve better accuracy as compared to the actual prices.},

  month = may,
  publisher = {{Oxford University Press}},
  abstract = {Parfit develops further his influential treatment of reasons, normativity, the meaning of moral discourse, and the status of morality. He engages with his critics, and shows the way to resolution of their differences. This volume is partly about what it is for things to matter, in the sense that we all have reasons to care about these things. Much of the book discusses three of the main kinds of meta-ethical theory: Normative Naturalism, Quasi-Realist Expressivism, and Non-Metaphysical Non-Naturalism, which Derek Parfit now calls Non-Realist Cognitivism. This third theory claims that, if we use the word 'reality' in an ontologically weighty sense, irreducibly normative truths have no mysterious or incredible ontological implications. If instead we use 'reality' in a wide sense, according to which all truths are truths about reality, this theory claims that some non-empirically discoverable truths-such as logical, mathematical, modal, and some normative truths-raise no difficult ontological questions. Parfit discusses these theories partly by commenting on the views of some of the contributors to Peter Singer's collection Does Anything Really Matter? Parfit on Objectivity. Though Peter Railton is a Naturalist, he has widened his view by accepting some further claims, and he has suggested that this wider version of Naturalism could be combined with Non-Realist Cognitivism. Parfit argues that Railton is right, since these theories no longer deeply disagree. Though Allan Gibbard is a Quasi-Realist Expressivist, he has suggested that the best version of his view could be combined with Non-Realist Cognitivism. Parfit argues that Gibbard is right, since Gibbard and he now accept the other's main meta-ethical claim. It is rare for three such different philosophical theories to be able to be widened in ways that resolve their deepest disagreements. This happy convergence supports the view that these meta-ethical theories are true. Parfit also discusses the views of several other philosophers, and some other meta-ethical and normative questions.},

  abstract = {Emergency frames are mobilized in contemporary sustainability debates, both in response to specific events and strategically. The strategic deployment of emergency frames by proponents of sustainability action aims to stimulate collective action on issues for which it is lacking. But this is contentious due to a range of possible effects. We critically review interdisciplinary social science literature to examine the political effects of emergency frames in sustainability and develop a typology of five key dimensions of variation. This pinpoints practical areas for evaluating the utility of emergency frames and builds a shared vocabulary for analysis and decision-making.},

  abstract = {Semantic memory corresponds to people's general conceptual knowledge about objects and events, including knowledge about their characteristic properties and behaviours, as well as knowledge about the words we use to name and describe objects and events in speech.Whereas episodic memory encompasses memory for specific episodes or situations in one's life, semantic memory encompasses factual knowledge divorced from any specific situational context: ``a scallop is an edible sea creature'' (semantic) as opposed to ``I ate scallops for supper last night'' (episodic).Essentially all theories agree that a widely distributed brain network is responsible for our semantic knowledge of modality-specific features (for example, what a scallop looks or tastes like); but the theories differ on whether this network is sufficient for all of the functions of semantic memory.The theory highlighted in this review proposes that conceptual knowledge requires an amodal hub, which itself contains no semantic features but rather represents the semantic similarity among concepts \textemdash{} for example, the semantic similarity between scallops and prawns, despite their differences in virtually every modality-specific attribute.This theory predicts that a lesion of the specific brain region supporting the amodal hub should disrupt all abilities requiring central conceptual knowledge, independent of the modality of input (such as objects, words or sounds) or output (such as speaking, drawing or using objects) and independent of the type of concept (living things, man-made objects and abstract ideas, for example).Patients with semantic dementia, a neurodegenerative syndrome resulting from focal atrophy of the anterior temporal lobes (ATL) bilaterally, show precisely this pattern of semantic degradation across all modalities and all types of conceptual knowledge; therefore, semantic dementia suggests that the ATL supports an amodal hub.Functional neuroimaging studies of semantic processing only sometimes reveal activation in the ATL. The likelihood of activation in this region, however, can be predicted by a combination of the specific imaging techniques employed and the specificity of semantic processing required by the imaging task.Simulations of semantic memory in connectionist models suggest one reason why the semantic network might require a hub: without such an architecture, it is not clear how the system can learn representations that capture semantic similarity relations.},

The interventions that have received the most empirical support are early behavioral interventions.

  abstract = {Society has already accepted the use of physical implants that increase an individual's seductive power as well as technological implants that correct physical disabilities. Various companies are currently developing technological implants to increase the innate capacity of the human body (insideables) (e.g., memory implants). Public acceptance of this new technology has not yet been investigated in academic research, where studies have instead focused on the ethical and evolutionary implications of insideables. The main aim of this study is the development of a model, namely the Cognitive-Affective-Normative (CAN) model, for assessing the acceptance of new types of technological products. The CAN model combines the cognitive variables perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as the normative variable subjective (or social) norm, from the TAM models with the affective variables positive emotions, negative emotions and anxiety. The CAN model was tested on a sample of 600 randomly selected individuals through structural equation modeling. Data were obtained from a self-administered, online survey. The proposed model explains 73.92\% of the intention to use the technological product in the very early stages of its adoption, that is, its early acceptance. Affective and normative factors have the greatest influence on the acceptance of a new technology; within the affective dimension, positive emotions have the greatest impact. Any technology acceptance model should thus consider the emotions that the new technology produces, as well as the influence of the social norm.},

Cyborgs, understood as healthy people who decide to integrate their bodies with insideable technology, are no longer science fiction, but fact. The cyborg market will be a huge new business with important consequences for both industry and society. More specifically, cyborg technologies are a unique product, with a potentially critical impact on the future of humanity. In light of the potential transformations involved in the creation of ``superhuman'' cyborgs, ethics must be a cornerstone of cyborg marketing decisions. Businesses need to take ethics into account, not only to ensure they behave ethically, as always, but also because ethics will be an important factor in buyers' decisions in the emerging cyborg market. This is because the decision to become a cyborg is determined, among many other factors, by ethical judgment. Our research focuses on how the dimensions of the Composite Multidimensional Ethics Scale (Composite MES) influence an individual's decision to become a cyborg. To test our hypotheses, we surveyed a total of 1563 higher-education students in seven different countries. The results of the survey show that ethical judgment will be a keystone in individual cyborgization. Specifically, ethical dimensions explained 48\% of the intention to use cyborg technologies. The ethical analysis showed that not all MES dimensions have the same influence on the ethical judgment regarding this decision. Egoism was the most influential dimension, while contractualism was the least. These findings have important implications for both academia and business.},

Firstly, it finds that RRI approaches invoke three main types of moral reasoning to define responsibility corresponding to key philosophical traditions: proceduralism, consequentialism and virtue ethics. The paper analyses how RRI approaches differ in the kind of elements they borrow from these three traditions. Secondly, the paper shows that this analytical reflection about the normative strategies followed by RRI approaches helps to better understand the tension existing between, on the one hand, the modern requirement of pluralism in democratic societies to allow for various value systems to influence the decision-making process and, on the other, the applicability of normative theories that demands specific and practical norms to be identified. The paper aims to show how each type of moral reasoning strategy used by most RRI approaches deals with this tension and how each attempts to resolve it.},

Identifying the current overlaps, and making a comparative analysis with two previous proposals for the categorization of responses to anthropogenic climate change, this article presents a new categorization proposal directed to promote the essential rapprochement between the scientific community and policymakers. This proposal removes the term geoengineering, pointing out the advantages of a debate specifically oriented toward each method in particular. It is also explained how each category should be envisaged, rethinking the importance of international cooperation and stressing the decisive impact that public awareness could play in dealing with this challenge.},

The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies' ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat.},

The study features an online survey and large-scale sampling in the US (304 respondents) with data analyzed using structural equation modeling. Three important results suggest 1) consumers' nature-based values have the most positive influence on consumers' support for sustainable businesses, 2) followed by attitude toward firm benevolence, and 3) concern about the ethicality of firms. Valuing social justice and recognizing business' contribution to one's own quality of life did not register as being influential on consumers' support for sustainable businesses.},

This paper contributes to the emerging debate about the social acceptability of geoengineering technologies by presenting preliminary evidence on public responses to geoengineering from two of the very first UK studies of public perceptions and responses. The discussion draws upon two datasets: qualitative data (from an interview study conducted in 42 households in 2009), and quantitative data (from a subsequent nationwide survey (n=1822) of British public opinion). Unsurprisingly, baseline awareness of geoengineering was extremely low in both cases. The data from the survey indicate that, when briefly explained to people, carbon dioxide removal approaches were preferred to solar radiation management, while significant positive correlations were also found between concern about climate change and support for different geoengineering approaches. We discuss some of the wider considerations that are likely to shape public perceptions of geoengineering as it enters the media and public sphere, and conclude that, aside from technical considerations, public perceptions are likely to prove a key element influencing the debate over questions of the acceptability of geoengineering proposals.},

  abstract = {The emerging field of soft robotics presents a new paradigm for robot design in which ``precision through rigidity'' is replaced by ``cognition through compliance.'' Lightweight and flexible, soft robots have vast potential to interact with fragile objects and navigate unstructured environments. Like octopuses and worms in nature, soft robots' flexible bodies conform to hard objects and reconfigure for different tasks, delegating the burden of control from brain to body through embodied cognition. However, because of the lack of efficient modeling and simulation tools, soft robots are primarily designed by hand. Typically, hard components from rigid robots or living creatures are heuristically substituted for comparable soft ones. Autonomous design and manufacturing methodologies are urgently required to produce bespoke, high-performing robots. Currently, design methodologies exist between simple but realistic parametric optimizations, and evolutionary algorithms which simulate morphology and control coevolution. To find high-performing designs, novel high-fidelity simulators and high-throughput manufacturing and testing processes are required to explore the complex soft material, morphology and control landscape, blending simulation, and experimental data. This article reviews the state of the art in autonomous soft robotic design. Existing manual and automated designs are surveyed and future directions to automate soft robot design and manufacturing are presented.},

Its effectiveness as simulated by Earth system models exhibits, however, large uncertainties, implying high risks for natural and human ecosystems. Here we identify an emergent relationship linking the long-term global land surface cooling due to SRM-SAI and the short-term cooling following the twentieth century major volcanic eruptions across an Earth system models ensemble. This emergent relationship, combined with observations and reanalysis data, is used to constrain the global land surface temperature (LT) response to reduced downward solar radiation. Based on these constraints, we find a mean decrease in land surface temperature of 0.44 K{$\cdot$}W-1{$\cdot$}m2, 20\% smaller than the unconstrained multimodel mean. This new estimate may affect how trade-offs between cost, risk, and effectiveness of SRM-SAI might be considered.},

The resulting network is a representation of the coding data that characterizes the interrelations of codes. This approach enables quantification of qualitative codes using network analysis and facilitates examination of associations of network indices with other quantitative variables using common statistical procedures. Here, as a proof of concept, we applied this method to a set of interview transcripts that had been coded in 2 different ways and the resultant network graphs were examined. The creation of network graphs allows researchers an opportunity to view and share their qualitative data in an innovative way that may provide new insights and enhance transparency of the analytical process by which they reach their conclusions.

  abstract = {Plant movements are of increasing interest for biomimetic approaches where hinge-free compliant mechanisms (flexible structures) for applications, for example, in architecture, soft robotics, and medicine are developed. In this article, we first concisely summarize the knowledge on plant movement principles and show how the different modes of actuation, that is, the driving forces of motion, can be used in biomimetic approaches for the development of motile technical systems. We then emphasize on current developments and breakthroughs in the field, that is, the technical implementation of plant movement principles through additive manufacturing, the development of structures capable of tracking movements (tropisms), and the development of structures that can perform multiple movement steps. Regarding the additive manufacturing section, we present original results on the successful transfer of several plant movement principles into 3D printed hygroscopic shape-changing structures (``4D printing''). The resulting systems include edge growth-driven actuation (as known from the petals of the lily flower), bending scale-like structures with functional bilayer setups (inspired from pinecones), modular aperture architectures (as can be similarly seen in moss peristomes), snap-through elastic instability actuation (as known from Venus flytrap snap-traps), and origami-like curved-folding kinematic amplification (inspired by the carnivorous waterwheel plant). Our novel biomimetic compliant mechanisms highlight the feasibility of modern printing techniques for designing and developing versatile tailored motion responses for technical applications. We then focus on persisting challenges in the field, that is, how to speed-boost intrinsically slow hydraulically actuated structures and how to achieve functional resilience and robustness, before we propose the establishment of a motion design catalog in the conclusion.},

Previous research concludes that people often do not support and legitimize such taxes because they perceive them as unfair. However, the notion of fairness implies a multitude of factors and despite attempts of the previous research to further nuance people's fairness perceptions, we currently lack a more precise understanding of what people mean when they regard carbon taxes as unfair. In this article, we thoroughly investigate this problem by using original survey data from YouGov collected in the United States in 2018 and analyzing open-ended survey responses on why people think carbon taxes are unfair. Applying structural topic modeling, we unpack the multi-dimensional meaning of unfairness, as perceived by the US population. The results from our analysis show that people regard carbon taxes based on gas pricing as unfair because they perceive gas prices already being high, because of the need to drive, unfairness for the poor or rural population, lack of trust in government, or considerations that the purpose of the tax is unjustified. These findings help provide a more nuanced policy design to address fairness concerns related to carbon taxes.},

We highlight how an emphasis on central themes of importance in feminist theory and care ethics such as relationality, contextuality, dependence, power, affect, and narrative can shine a light on a number of salient issues that are typically missed by the dominant and largely consequentialist risk assessment frame. We argue that the care ethics lens is a better fit when technologies are understood not simply as devices designed to create a certain end experience for a user but as transformative systems that smuggle in numerous social and political interests. The advantages of these care ethics themes for emerging technologies are illustrated through a detailed consideration of agricultural biotechnology. We show how the feminist care ethics lens might have anticipated the very questions that have proved themselves to be the sticking points for this technology. We therefore suggest that applying a care ethics lens can significantly broaden the frame of appraisal processes used for the governance of emerging technologies and usefully grant legitimacy to questions and concerns that are prominent in public discourse but typically left out of practices of risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Engineering the Climate: The Ethics of Solar Radiation Management discusses the ethical issues associated with deliberately engineering a cooler climate to combat global warming. Climate engineering (also known as geoengineering) has recently experienced a surge of interest given the growing likelihood that the global community will fail to limit the temperature increases associated with greenhouse gases to safe levels. Deliberate manipulation of solar radiation to combat climate change is an exciting and hopeful technical prospect, promising great benefits to those who are in line to suffer most through climate change. At the same time, the prospect of geoengineering creates huge controversy. Taking intentional control of earth's climate would be an unprecedented step in environmental management, raising a number of difficult ethical questions. One particular form of geoengineering, solar radiation management (SRM), is known to be relatively cheap and capable of bringing down global temperatures very rapidly. However, the complexity of the climate system creates considerable uncertainty about the precise nature of SRM's effects in different regions. The ethical issues raised by the prospect of SRM are both complex and thorny. They include: 1) the uncertainty of SRM's effects on precipitation patterns, 2) the challenge of proper global participation in decision-making, 3) the legitimacy of intentionally manipulating the global climate system in the first place, 4) the potential to sidestep the issue of dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, and, 5) the lasting effects on future generations. It has been widely acknowledged that a sustained and scholarly treatment of the ethics of SRM is necessary before it will be possible to make fair and just decisions about whether (or how) to proceed. This book, including essays by 13 experts in the field of ethics of geoengineering, is intended to go some distance towards providing that treatment.},

Alongside the considerable optimism that these technologies have generated, there has also been wide acknowledgement of significant ethical concerns. Ethicists, social scientists, and experts in governance have begun the work of addressing these concerns. The plethora of ethical issues raised by geoengineering creates challenges for those who wish to survey them. The issues are here separated out according to the temporal spaces in which they first arise. Some crop up when merely contemplating the prospect of geoengineering. Others appear as research gets underway. Another set of issues attend the actual implementation of the technologies. A further set occurs when planning for the cessation of climate engineering. Two cautions about this organizational schema are in order. First, even if the issues first arise in the temporal spaces identified, they do not stay completely contained within them. A good reason to object to the prospect of geoengineering, for example, will likely remain a good reason to object to its implementation. Second, the ethical concerns intensify or weaken depending on the technology under consideration. The wide range of geoengineering technologies currently being discussed makes it prudent that each technique should be evaluated individually for its ethical merit.

First, these new methods of assessing public opinion must be evaluated in terms of specific quality criteria that apply to different phases and/or participants in the democratic decision making process. Some techniques attempt to maximize several distinct qualities at once, making it difficult to identify specific objectives for evaluating success. Second, at least five important core methodological elements of educational or deliberative polls can be identified, each of which can theoretically alter results. To date, however, data bearing upon the effects of these methodological elements are in limited supply. Lack of knowledge about how method influences individual and collective opinion outcomes thus renders several of these techniques problematic.},

This paper addresses several general sets of questions. What is meant by `quality' in public opinion? What criteria can be enumerated by which the quality of public opinion can be assessed? In grappling with these questions, the paper argues that conceptions of quality in public opinion are inextricably bound to broader conceptions of quality in democratic decision making, a complex process involving multiple phases and collective participants. In addition, a number of important contradictions and ambiguities underlie conceptions of quality in public opinion.},

This study aims to analyze people's sentiments about the impact of technology on employment and advancements in technologies and build a machine learning classifier to classify the sentiments. People are getting nervous, depressed, and even doing suicides due to unemployment; hence, it is essential to explore this relatively new area of research. The study has two main objectives 1) to preprocess text collected from Twitter concerning the impact of technology on employment and analyze its sentiment, 2) to evaluate the performance of machine learning Na\"ive Bayes (NB) classifier on the text. To achieve this, a methodology is proposed that includes 1) data collection and preprocessing 2) analyze sentiment, 3) building machine learning classifier and 4) compare the performance of NB and support vector machine (SVM). NB and SVM achieved 87.18\% and 82.05\% accuracy, respectively. The study found that 65\% of people hold negative sentiment regarding the impact of technology on employment and technological advancements; hence, people must acquire new skills to minimize the effect of structural unemployment.},

We propose a stylized model of intergenerational decision making on SRM research, greenhouse-gas abatement and SRM deployment, under uncertainties about (a) the extent of future climate damage and (b) effectiveness and potential harmful side-effects of SRM. Open-ended research may reveal either that SRM effectively reduces climate damage, or that it would cause more harm than benefits. We find that SRM research increases the likelihood of deployment (``slippery slope''), and derive conditions that it decreases abatement effort in expectation (``moral hazard''). Neither of these provides a rationale against SRM research, though. The rational decision is to perform SRM research, unless (i) discounting is hyperbolic and (ii) the absolute prudence of expected climate damage is smaller than absolute risk aversion. These results generalize to the case where SRM research also provides information on climate sensitivity.},

A total of 527 drivers participated in the research, completing Chinese versions of the Self-driving Car Acceptance Scale, the Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Big Five Inventory and some demographic questions. The results showed that trait anxiety had a positive effect on perceived automation reliability. Openness and extraversion had positive effects on self-driving car acceptance, while neuroticism had a negative effect. People with high agreeableness had a more positive perspective on the benefits of self-driving cars, but they were also more worried about ease of use and automation reliability. These results help to provide a personality profile of early adopters of self-driving cars. People with certain personality traits are more likely to be starting points for the diffusion of self-driving cars.},

Data for this study was gathered using published articles, websites, blogs, and visual and numerical artefacts. We have analyzed, synthesized, and described our gathered data using an "introductory literature review." The findings revealed that for the initial idea generation for academic scientific research, ChatGPT could be an effective tool. However, in the case of literature synthesis, citations, problem statements, research gaps, and data analysis, the researchers might encounter some challenges. Therefore, in these cases, researchers must be cautious about using ChatGPT in academic research. Considering the potential applications and consequences of ChatGPT, it is a must for the academic and scientific community to establish the necessary guidelines for the appropriate use of LLMs, especially ChatGPT, in research and publishing.},

Across four studies, we investigate discomfort with tampering with the natural world. To do so, we develop the Aversion to Tampering with Nature (ATN) Scale, a short scale that is the first to directly measure this discomfort. We identify six activities that people believe tamper with nature (geoengineering, genetically modified organisms, pesticides, cloning, gene therapy, and nanoparticles) and show that ATN scores are associated with opposition to these activities. Furthermore, the ATN Scale predicts actual behavior: donations to an anti-tampering cause. We demonstrate that ATN is related to previously identified constructs including trust in technology, naturalness bias, purity values, disgust sensitivity, aversion to playing God, and environmental beliefs and values. By illuminating who is concerned about tampering with nature and what predicts these beliefs, the ATN Scale provides opportunities to better understand public opposition to technological innovations, consumer preferences for ``natural'' products, and strategies for science communication.},

An experiment with a US sample found, contrary to previous research, that reading about geoengineering did not reduce conservatives' skepticism about the existence of anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, depending on how it is framed, geoengineering can reduce support for mitigation among both conservatives and non-conservatives. When geoengineering is framed as a major solution, people worry less about climate change, leading to reduced mitigation support. When framed as disastrous, people perceived geoengineering as riskier, also leading to a decrease in mitigation support. A more moderate framing of geoengineering as a partial solution is less susceptible to moral hazard effects. Overall, results suggest that geoengineering will not lessen political polarization over anthropogenic climate change, and could undercut support for mitigation efforts. Instead, framing geoengineering as a small piece to solving a big puzzle seems to be the best strategy to weaken this potential moral hazard.},

  abstract = {Randomized response techniques (RRTs) are useful survey tools for estimating the prevalence of sensitive issues, such as the prevalence of doping in elite sports. One type of RRT, the unrelated question model (UQM), has become widely used because of its psychological acceptability for study participants and its favorable statistical properties. One drawback of this model, however, is that it does not allow for detecting cheaters?individuals who disobey the survey instructions and instead give self-protecting responses. In this article, we present refined versions of the UQM designed to detect the prevalence of cheating responses. We provide explicit formulas to calculate the parameters of these refined UQM versions and show how the empirical adequacy of these versions can be tested. The Appendices contain R-code for all necessary calculations.},

Ethical considerations concerning the impacts of R\&I are increasingly important, due to the quickening pace of technological innovation and the ubiquitous use of the outcomes of R\&I processes in society. For this reason, several methods for practising ethics have been developed in different fields of R\&I. The paper first of all presents a systematic search of academic sources that present and discuss such methods. Secondly, it provides a categorisation of these methods according to three main kinds: (1) ex ante methods, dealing with emerging technologies, (2) intra methods, dealing with technology design, and (3) ex post methods, dealing with ethical analysis of existing technologies. Thirdly, it discusses the methods by considering problems in the way they deal with the uncertainty of technological change, ethical technology design, the identification, analysis and resolving of ethical impacts of technologies and stakeholder participation. The results and discussion of our literature review are valuable for gaining an overview of the state of the art and serve as an outline of a future research agenda of methods for practising ethics in R\&I.},

The model is tested on a sample of 900 individuals segmented by their ethical assessment of these insideables: ethically in favor, ethically against, or ethically indifferent. The results show that an individual's ethical assessment of memory implants explains differences in his or her intention to use them but does not moderate the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, positive emotions, negative emotions, or social influence on the intention to use them. The results have theoretical implications for technology acceptance models and open new lines of research concerning the future cyborg society.},

The types of web-based research discussed are web surveys and questionnaire research, web-based tests, web experiments, Mobile Experience Sampling, and non-reactive web research, including big data. A number of web-based methods are presented and discussed that turned out to become important in research methodology. These are one-item-one-screen design, seriousness check, instruction manipulation and other attention checks, multiple site entry technique, subsampling technique, warm-up technique, and web-based measurement. Pitfalls and best practices are described then, especially regarding dropout and other non-response, recruitment of participants, and interaction between technology and psychological factors. The review concludes with a discussion of important concepts that have developed over 25 years and an outlook on future developments in web-based research.

With all 3 changes, DIT2 is an improvement over DIT1. The validity criteria for DIT2 are (a) significant age and educational differences among 9th graders, high school graduates, college seniors, and students in graduate and professional schools; (b) prediction of views on public policy issues (e.g., abortion, religion in schools, rights of homosexuals, women's roles); (c) internal reliability; and (d) correlation with DIT1. However, the increased power of DIT2 over DIT1 is primarily due to the new methods of analysis (a new index called N2, new checks) rather than to changes in dilemmas, items, or instructions. Although DIT2 presents updated dilemmas and smoother wording in a shorter test (practical improvements), the improvements in analyses account for the validity improvements.

To compile this list of attributes, 14 guided expert interviews were conducted. The extensive list which was compiled in this work confirms the usefulness of expert interviews as a method to collect basal attributes of new materials systems.

While CAMs were originally used primarily to visualize existing data, the recent release of the new software tool Valence has facilitated the applicability of CAMs for empirical data collection. In this article, we explain the concept and the theoretical background of CAMs. We exemplify how CAMs can be applied in research practice, including different options for analysis.

We investigated how leisure walking affects individuals' attitudes to the pandemic. We used Cognitive-Affective Maps (CAMs) to measure individual's cognitive and affective attitudes toward the corona pandemic and related issues. In a controlled randomized experiment, we asked (N = 66) participants to draw a CAM before and after a walk. Participants in a control group drew CAMs before and after any self-chosen activity at home. We found that walking led to a more negative evaluation of the pandemic itself, likely due to a more intense reflection, while in everyday routines one has already adapted to it. In further qualitative post hoc assessments of the CAMs, we observed that negative concepts other than corona disappeared after walking. We conclude that leisure walks have complex effects on individuals' cognitive and affective conceptualization of the corona pandemic. Hence, the exact mechanisms of these effects need to be examined in future research. Our study has also shown that CAMs are a promising tool for measuring experimental interventions in health psychology.},

The model suggests that ethical decision making involves 2 interrelated yet functionally distinct cycles, a reflexive pattern matching cycle and a higher order conscious reasoning cycle, and thereby describes not only reasoned analysis, but also the intuitive and retrospective aspects of ethical decision making. The model sparks research in new areas, holds significant implications for the study of ethical decision making, and provides suggestions for improving ethical behavior in organizations.

  abstract = {The autonomous vehicle (AV) is one of the first commercialized AI-embedded robots to make autonomous decisions. Despite technological advancements, unavoidable AV accidents that result in life-and-death consequences cannot be completely eliminated. The emerging social concern of how an AV should make ethical decisions during unavoidable accidents is referred to as the moral dilemma of AV, which has promoted heated discussions among various stakeholders. However, there are research gaps in explainable AV ethical decision-making processes that predict how AVs' moral behaviors are made that are acceptable from the AV users' perspectives. This study addresses the key question: What factors affect ethical behavioral intentions in the AV moral dilemma? To answer this question, this study draws theories from multidisciplinary research fields to propose the "Integrative ethical decision-making framework for the AV moral dilemma." The framework includes four interdependent ethical decision-making stages: AV moral dilemma issue framing, intuitive moral reasoning, rational moral reasoning, and ethical behavioral intention making. Further, the framework includes variables (e.g., perceived moral intensity, individual factors, and personal moral philosophies) that influence the ethical decision-making process. For instance, the framework explains that AV users from Eastern cultures will tend to endorse a situationist ethics position (high idealism and high relativism), which views that ethical decisions are relative to context, compared to AV users from Western cultures. This proposition is derived from the link between individual factors and personal moral philosophy. Moreover, the framework proposes a dual-process theory, which explains that both intuitive and rational moral reasoning are integral processes of ethical decision-making during the AV moral dilemma. Further, this framework describes that ethical behavioral intentions that lead to decisions in the AV moral dilemma are not fixed, but are based on how an individual perceives the seriousness of the situation, which is shaped by their personal moral philosophy. This framework provides a step-by-step explanation of how pluralistic ethical decision-making occurs, reducing the abstractness of AV moral reasoning processes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400\textendash 1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2\textdegree C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

As a predictor of behavior, CMD has been attacked on the theoretical level, and its empirical performance has been weak. This article uses another established construct, which seems to satisfy the central criticisms of CMD, as a means of testing those complaints. The comparative multidimensional ethics scale (MES) substantially outperforms CMD, operationalized using Rest's Defining Issues Test, in every test. These results seem to suggest that other options perform better than CMD when the purpose is to model ethical/unethical behavior or even ethical judgment.},

The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6\textendash 3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100. More can be achieved, because the agreement stipulates that targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strengthened over time, both in ambition and scope. Substantial enhancement or over-delivery on current INDCs by additional national, sub-national and non-state actions is required to maintain a reasonable chance of meeting the target of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius.},

Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky. To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among their circle of acquaintances\textemdash a process which typically takes months or years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for example, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in the history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between people. The fifth edition addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas.},

Such models predominate despite the fact that many nonrational factors influence ethical thought and behavior, including context, perceptions, relationships, emotions, and heuristics. For example, a large body of behavioral research has demonstrated the importance of automatic intuitive and affective processes in decision making and judgment. These processes profoundly affect human behavior and lead to systematic biases and departures from normative theories of rationality. Their influence represents an important but largely unrecognized component of ethical decision making. We selectively review this work; provide various illustrations; and make recommendations for scientists, trainers, and practitioners to aid them in integrating the understanding of nonrational processes with ethical decision making.

We aimed to answer the following questions: 1) How has the perceived importance of naturalness for consumers been defined and measured? 2) To what extent is perceived naturalness important to consumers? 3) Are there individual differences regarding the importance given to food naturalness that can be explained by consumers' characteristics? 4) Do consumers' attitudes toward food naturalness influence their intentions and behavior? Key findings and conclusions The review clearly shows that for the majority of consumers, food naturalness is crucial. This finding could be observed across countries and in the different years when the studies were conducted. Therefore, neglecting the aspect of naturalness in the food industry may be very costly in the end. Our review also reveals differences across studies in how naturalness has been defined and measured. Based on a content analysis of the measurement scales, the items used to measure the importance of naturalness can be classified into three categories: 1) the way the food has been grown (food origin), 2) how the food has been produced (what technology and ingredients have been used), and 3) the properties of the final product.},

The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a material that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word embedding models in details, thus preventing researchers that are non-experts in neural networks from understanding the working mechanism of such models. This note provides detailed derivations and explanations of the parameter update equations of the word2vec models, including the original continuous bag-of-word (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) models, as well as advanced optimization techniques, including hierarchical softmax and negative sampling. Intuitive interpretations of the gradient equations are also provided alongside mathematical derivations. In the appendix, a review on the basics of neuron networks and backpropagation is provided. I also created an interactive demo, wevi, to facilitate the intuitive understanding of the model.},

Given the often redundant nature of new scales, psychological science is struggling with arbitrary measurement, construct dilution, and disconnection between research groups. To address these issues, we introduce an easy-to-use online application: the Semantic Scale Network. The purpose of this application is to automatically detect semantic overlap between scales through latent semantic analysis. Authors and reviewers can enter the items of a new scale into the application, and receive quantifications of semantic overlap with related scales in the application's corpus. Contrary to traditional assessments of scale overlap, the application can support expert judgments on scale redundancy without access to empirical data or awareness of every potentially related scale. After a brief introduction to measures of semantic similarity in texts, we introduce the Semantic Scale Network and provide best practices for interpreting its outputs.

It is unclear whether this positive framing of robots by narratives works equally for different robot design approaches and appearances. To address this open question we conducted 2\texttimes 6 between-subjects online experiment and varied the introduction (narrative vs. instruction manual) and appearance of the robot (6 different robot appearances). We replicated previous results on evaluation effects for different robot appearances. Results indicate that robots introduced by a narrative story were evaluated as being more likable, intelligent, autonomous, and humanlike. They were also perceived to be less mechanical and less uncanny. However, there were no interaction effects between narration and robot appearance suggesting that narration is beneficial for robots regardless of their appearance and hence is a strong mechanism to shape positive expectations before actually interacting with a robot.},

In analyses with nonlinear models, unmodeled variability from the selection of items or participants may lead to asymptotically biased estimation. This asymptotic bias, in turn, renders inference problematic. We show, for example, that a signal detection analysis of recognition memory data leads to asymptotic underestimation of sensitivity. To eliminate asymptotic bias, we advocate hierarchical models in which participant variability, item variability, and measurement error are modeled simultaneously. By accounting for multiple sources of variability, hierarchical models yield consistent and accurate estimates of participant and item effects in recognition memory. This article is written in tutorial format; we provide an introduction to Bayesian statistics, hierarchical modeling, and Markov chain Monte Carlo computational techniques.},

For this situation and objective, I believe that multiple imputation by the data-base constructor is the method of choice. This article first provides a description of the assumed context and objectives, and second, reviews the multiple imputation framework and its standard results. These preliminary discussions are especially important because some recent commentaries on multiple imputation have reflected either misunderstandings of the practical objectives of multiple imputation or misunderstandings of fundamental theoretical results. Then, criticisms of multiple imputation are considered, and, finally, comparisons are made to alternative strategies.},

  abstract = {The search for new, authentic science assessments of what students know and can do is well under way. This has unearthed measures of students' hands-on performance in carrying out science investigations, and has been expanded to discover more or less direct measures of students' knowledge structures. One potential finding is concept mapping, the focus of this review. A concept map is a graph consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines denoting the relation between a pair of nodes. A student's concept map is interpreted as representing important aspects of the organization of concepts in his or her memory (cognitive structure). In this article we characterize a concept map used as an assessment tool as: (a) a task that elicits evidence bearing on a student's knowledge structure in a domain, (b) a format for the student's response, and (c) a scoring system by which the student's concept map can be evaluated accurately and consistently. Based on this definition, multiple concept-mapping techniques were found from the myriad of task, response format, and scoring system variations identified in the literature. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the reliability and validity of these variations. The review led us to arrive at the following conclusions: (a) an integrative working cognitive theory is needed to begin to limit this variation in concept-mapping techniques for assessment purposes; (b) before concept maps are used for assessment and before map scores are reported to teachers, students, the public, and policy makers, research needs to provide reliability and validity information on the effect of different mapping techniques; and (c) research on students' facility in using concept maps, on training techniques, and on the effect on teaching is needed if concept map assessments are to be used in classrooms and in large-scale accountability systems. \textcopyright{} 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

International large scale assessments (ILSAs) have been targeted as a rich data sources for causal research. It is in this context that we take up a discussion around causal inferences and ILSAs. Although these rich, carefully developed studies have much to offer in terms of understanding educational systems, we argue that the conditions for making strong causal inferences are rarely met. To develop our argument we first discuss, in general, the nature of causal inferences and then suggest and apply a validity framework to evaluate the tenability of claims made in two well-cited studies. The cited studies exemplify interesting design features and advances in methods of data analysis and certainly contribute to the knowledge base in educational research; however, methodological shortcomings, some of which are unavoidable even in the best of circumstances, urge a more cautious interpretation than that of strict ``cause and effect.'' We then discuss how findings from causal-focused research may not provide answers to the often broad questions posed by the policy community. We conclude with examples of the importance of the validity framework for the ILSA research community and a suggestion of what should be included in studies that wish to employ quasi-experimental methods with ILSA data.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Ethical analysis can highlight important ethical issues related to implementing a technology, values inherent in the technology itself, and value-decisions underlying the health technology assessment (HTA) process. Ethical analysis is a well-acknowledged part of HTA, yet seldom included in practice. One reason for this is lack of knowledge about the properties and differences between the methods available. This study compares different methods for ethical analysis within HTA.Methods: Ethical issues related to bariatric (obesity) surgery were independently evaluated using axiological, casuist, principlist, and EUnetHTA models for ethical analysis within HTA. The methods and results are presented and compared.Results: Despite varying theoretical underpinnings and practical approaches, the four methods identified similar themes: personal responsibility, self-infliction, discrimination, justice, public funding, and stakeholder involvement. The axiological and EUnetHTA models identified a wider range of arguments, whereas casuistry and principlism concentrated more on analyzing a narrower set of arguments deemed more important.Conclusions: Different methods can be successfully used for conducting ethical analysis within HTA. Although our study does not show that different methods in ethics always produce similar results, it supports the view that different methods of ethics can yield relevantly similar results. This suggests that the key conclusions of ethical analyses within HTA can be transferable between methods and countries. The systematic and transparent use of some method of ethics appears more important than the choice of the exact method.},

We report on user perceptions of "pheB," a non-anthropomorphic, bio-inspired, pneumatic-actuated robot surface aiming to help regulate our emotional states when inhabiting confined spaces, such as our homes. A survey (N = 50) tested perceived stress levels before and after performing guided breathing exercises under two conditions: led by the pheB prototype and a 2D vector graphic. We learned that perceived stress levels were significantly lower after performing the pheB led exercises. Comments from respondents who did not prefer pheB suggested a possible "Uncanny Valley" effect. The same survey elicited feedback on possible design features for pheB related to color, scale, orientation, and edge complexity. Beyond reporting on a soft robotic artifact of our own design, the research reported here offers an exemplar for conducting user studies online of novel robot designs, highlights user perceptions of bio-inspired robots in HRI research and considers biophilia and the uncanny valley for non-anthropomorphic robots supporting human-centered design applications.},

  abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book:  Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials.   Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls.   Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications.   Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds.  Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging.},

  abstract = {After years of missing the agreed upon goals for carbon reduction, we might conclude that global climate policies set infeasible standards to halt climate change. The widespread non-compliance of many signees with frameworks such as the Paris Agreement indicates that these frameworks were too optimistic regarding the signees' motivation to act. One of the suggested ways out of this impasse, is geoengineering, which is seen as a ``techno-fix'' of the non-compliance problem, relieving signees and other actors of some, or most, of their mitigation duties. This paper scrutinizes different approaches towards climate mitigation that focus on behavioral change or on technological solutions. We argue that these different approaches do not originate from categorically different theories of climate justice. Indeed, seemingly realistic and seemingly idealistic proposals do not disagree on the substance of climate justice, but about what is to be considered feasible. Furthermore, by applying this dialectic lens on ideal vs. non-ideal theorizing in the context of climate justice, we show that (backward-looking) residual responsibility is an overlooked aspect of geoengineering as a (forward-looking) non-ideal approach to achieve climate justice. We will outline three possible consequences of this moral residue: 1) Residual responsibility can provide grounds to demand compensation, 2) it can constitute other forward-looking responsibilities (e.g., the maintenance of geoengineering technologies) and 3) it provides a reason to employ other techno-fixes equal in effectiveness and risks that do not sidestep the problem of non-compliance.},

To determine satisfaction were included in the survey building, besides IEQ, building features, corporate fulfillment and individuals' ecofriendly attitude (sustainable practices). We applied semi-enclosed questionnaires with 6-points Likert-type scale with pictographic VAS to collect perceptions from employees and customers. We performed an exploratory factor analysis to summarize the main variables characteristics, data reduction and grouping in related indexes. Results shows that employees perceive green buildings spaces as better in comparison with conventional buildings employee's perception, but customers of both groups cannot tell differences between those edifices. Ecofriendly attitude was more often observed among green building employees than conventional employees, presenting positively correlated to best ranking other buildings characteristics. Findings indicate that green buildings employees not only considered IEQ better but also are more satisfied overall with the company, building features and even more propense to sustainable attitudes; yet customers do not perceive differences between buildings in any aspects.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes what we call "anticipatory governance", which refers most directly to building the capacity to manage emerging technologies while such management is still possible. It explicates a rationale for anticipatory governance and its three conditions: foresight, engagement, and integration. The chapter suggests that starting in the mid-1970s there has been some evolution of theory, practice, and policy towards an explicit commitment to anticipatory governance to address the uncertain futures of emerging technologies. Anticipatory governance provides a set of tools for focusing that attention in ways that are unavailable in the larger climate change discourses. Evaluating the reports' recommendations against anticipatory governance, we find that all five articulate foresight, engagement, and integration as high-level principles. Specifying the societal goals for those actively pursuing geoengineering research would provide an alternative evaluation scheme or a new mechanism to assess "progress".},

Experiments were conducted in a 2 x 2 x 2 between-subject design with 408 university students rating decks \`a 20 vignettes. Analyses of 7,895 ratings showed no differences of whether vignettes were presented as running texts or tables. Open scales revealed more measurement problems, e.g., missing values, than rating scales. Finally, vignettes presented randomly sorted produced similar results compared to sorting extreme vignette cases first. Recommendations based on the findings are to use random orders of vignettes and rating scales. Table vignettes provide an alternative to text vignettes but should be further evaluated with heterogeneous samples.},

This tendency kindled new debates about the limits and possibilities of empirical-normative collaboration. The article asks for adequate ways of collaboration by taking a closer look at the philosophy of science of empirical social sciences as well as normative theory development and its logical groundings. As a result, three possible modes of cooperation are characterized: first, the empirical assessment of conditions that actually necessitate the translation of normatively derived basic principles into practice rules; second, the empirical assessment of conditions for application of a moral norm which are formulated by bridging principles; third, the empirical assessment of social practice which allows (a) to measure whether adopted norms actually are implemented in practice or not and (b) to encounter new moral problems which are in need of ethical guidance. Finally, the article defends a symbiotic position in Weaver's and Trevino's triad of possible approaches to empirical-normative collaboration in ethics.},

Many believe that traditional data interpretation procedures based on statistical significance tests reduce the impact of sampling error on scientific inference. Meta-analysis shows that the significance test actually obscures underlying regularities and processes in individual studies and in research literatures, leading to systematically erroneous conclusions. Meta-analysis methods can solve these problems, and have done so in some areas. However, meta-analysis represents more than merely a change in methods of data analysis. It requires major changes in the way psychologists view the general research process. Views of the scientific value of the individual empirical study, the current reward structure in research, and even the fundamental nature of scientific discovery may change.

In order to identify strategies that may be most effective at increasing pedestrian and bicycle transportation in a specific local context, practitioners need a greater understanding of the underlying thought process that people use to select travel modes. Previous research from the travel behavior and psychology fields provides the foundation for a five-step, operational Theory of Routine Mode Choice Decisions. Walking and bicycling could be promoted through each of the five steps: awareness and availability (e.g., offer individual marketing programs), basic safety and security (e.g., make pedestrian and bicycle facility improvements and increase education and enforcement efforts), convenience and cost (e.g., institute higher-density, mixed land uses, and limited, more expensive automobile parking), enjoyment (e.g., plant street trees and increase awareness of non-motorized transportation benefits), and habit (e.g., target information about sustainable transportation options to people making key life changes). The components of the theory are supported by in-depth interview responses from the San Francisco Bay Area.},

  abstract = {Bayesian t tests have become increasingly popular alternatives to null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) in psychological research. In contrast to NHST, they allow for the quantification of evidence in favor of the null hypothesis and for optional stopping. A major drawback of Bayesian t tests, however, is that error probabilities of statistical decisions remain uncontrolled. Previous approaches in the literature to remedy this problem require time-consuming simulations to calibrate decision thresholds. In this article, we propose a sequential probability ratio test that combines Bayesian t tests with simple decision criteria developed by Abraham Wald in 1947. We discuss this sequential procedure, which we call Waldian t test, in the context of three recently proposed specifications of Bayesian t tests. Waldian t tests preserve the key idea of Bayesian t tests by assuming a distribution for the effect size under the alternative hypothesis. At the same time, they control expected frequentist error probabilities, with the nominal Type I and Type II error probabilities serving as upper bounds to the actual expected error rates under the specified statistical models. Thus, Waldian t tests are fully justified from both a Bayesian and a frequentist point of view. We highlight the relationship between Bayesian and frequentist error probabilities and critically discuss the implications of conventional stopping criteria for sequential Bayesian t tests. Finally, we provide a user-friendly web application that implements the proposed procedure for interested researchers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum efficiency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either \$\textbackslash mathcal \{H\}\_\{1\}\$or \$\textbackslash mathcal \{H\}\_\{0\}\$, and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.},

InnoMind is based on theories of emotional cognition from cognitive science, theories of attitudes and persuasion from social psychology, and theories of social networks from sociology. In a case study, we show how the model can be used to address practical research questions in environmental psychology: We describe computer simulations with InnoMind that can serve as ex-ante evaluations of suitable campaign strategies for the promotion of carsharing as an innovative means of sustainable urban transportation. We discuss how empirical/experimental versus computational/theoretical research strategies in environmental psychology can and should be regarded as mutually informative.},

Despite this drawback, we maintain that, with some modifications, the ethical matrix can be a useful tool in debates in food ethics. We argue that useful modifications might be to include future generations amongst the stakeholders in the matrix, and to substitute the principle of solidarity for the principle of justice.},

  abstract = {There is a broad consensus that individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) are strongly related to individual differences in intelligence. However, correlational studies do not allow conclusions about the causal nature of the relationship between WMC and fluid intelligence. While research on the cognitive basis of intelligence typically assumes that simpler lower-level cognitive processes contribute to individual differences in higher-order reasoning processes, a reversed causality or a third variable giving rise to two intrinsically uncorrelated variables may exist. In two studies (n1~=~65, n2~=~113), we investigated the causal nature of the relationship between WMC and intelligence by assessing the experimental effect of working memory load on intelligence test performance. Moreover, we tested if the effect of working memory load on intelligence test performance increased under time constraints, as previous studies have shown that the association between the two constructs increases if intelligence tests are administered with a strict time limit. We show that working memory load impaired intelligence test performance, but that this experimental effect was not affected by time constraints, which suggests that the experimental manipulations of working memory capacity and processing time did not affect the same underlying cognitive process. Using a computational modeling approach, we demonstrated that external memory load affected both the building and maintenance of relational item bindings and the filtering of irrelevant information in working memory. Our results confirm that WMC causally contributes to higher-order reasoning processes. Moreover, they support the hypothesis that working memory capacity in general and the abilities to maintain arbitrary bindings and to disengage from irrelevant information in particular are intrinsically related to intelligence.},

Hierzu werden die Hauptg\"utekriterien von Tests und Messungen sowie deren Bedeutung f\"ur latente Variablenmodelle diskutiert und mit Strategien der Modellevaluation verkn\"upft. Dabei wird insbesondere die Versprachlichung formaler Definitionen angestrebt, um die impliziten Charakteristika der Verfahren, welche in der Anwendung eine gewichtige Relevanz haben, herauszustellen und so einen reflektierten und passgenauen Einsatz dieser statistischen Modelltypen zu vereinfachen. Damit richtet sich diese Arbeit insbesondere an Anwender latenter Variablenmodelle in einem geisteswissenschaftlichen Kontext. Daf\"ur wird zuerst die Bedeutung statistischer Modelle mit latenten Variablen in den Bildungswissenschaften ausgef\"uhrt (Kap. 2) und in der Folge werden Theorien zur Definition latenter Variablen vorgestellt (Kap. 3). Es wird argumentiert, dass die verbreiteten Alltagsdefinitionen nicht ausreichend sind, und es wird ein definitorischer Rahmen vorgestellt, der sowohl eine theoretische als auch formale Ankn\"upfung erlaubt. Zudem werden verschiedene zentrale Modelltypen, deren Eigenschaften sowie eine generalisierte Betrachtungsweise kurz umrissen (Kap.3.1). Die Basis f\"ur die Verkn\"upfung statistischer Modelle und deren theoretischen Annahmen bilden die Mess- und Testtheorie. Die impliziten Annahmen und deren Implikationen werden in Kapitel 3.2 herausgestellt. Sofern eine theoretische Verkn\"upfung und eine Modellbildung gelungen ist, k\"onnen Evidenzen angesammelt werden, \"uber die auf vorl\"aufige stochastische Kausalit\"at geschlossen werden kann (Kap. 3.3). Zur Bewertung vorliegender Evidenz sind wissenschaftliche Normen und Standards von Bedeutung.

Second, the proposed model, called `Integrated Ethical Decision Making,' is introduced in order to fill the gaps and bridge the current divide in EDM theory.

It discusses the nature of values and spells out the features that are common to all values and what distinguishes one value from another. The theory identifies ten basic personal values that are recognized across cultures and explains where they come from. At the heart of the theory is the idea that values form a circular structure that reflects the motivations each value expresses. This circular structure, that captures the conflicts and compatibility among the ten values is apparently culturally universal. The article elucidates the psychological principles that give rise to it. Next, it presents the two major methods developed to measure the basic values, the Schwartz Value Survey and the Portrait Values Questionnaire. Findings from 82 countries, based on these and other methods, provide evidence for the validity of the theory across cultures. The findings reveal substantial differences in the value priorities of individuals. Surprisingly, however, the average value priorities of most societal groups exhibit a similar hierarchical order whose existence the article explains. The last section of the article clarifies how values differ from other concepts used to explain behavior\textemdash attitudes, beliefs, norms, and traits.},

The theory defines and orders 19 values on the continuum based on their compatible and conflicting motivations, expression of self-protection versus growth, and personal versus social focus. We assess the theory with a new instrument in 15 samples from 10 countries (N = 6,059). Confirmatory factor and multidimensional scaling analyses support discrimination of the 19 values, confirming the refined theory. Multidimensional scaling analyses largely support the predicted motivational order of the values. Analyses of predictive validity demonstrate that the refined values theory provides greater and more precise insight into the value underpinnings of beliefs. Each value correlates uniquely with external variables. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

This paper presents a comprehensive review of necessary steps and obstacles during the development and implementation of user centric business models, including a detailed discussion of required data and computational methods as well as psychological aspects of consumer participation. In addition, we aim to identify current challenges and future research needs.},

It focuses on the question of how the characteristics openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and willingness to take risks affect people's acceptance of new technologies. Within the framework of the literature review, a total of 378 topic-relevant results were analyzed and ultimately a sample of 22 studies selected to reflect the current state of research. Upon review, most of these studies provide significant results for each of the six personality traits. Furthermore, it was found that most researchers use the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to measure technology acceptance and that the samples consisted mainly of students. In view of the increasing use of intelligent technologies in almost all areas of life, it is particularly important to continuously investigate the factors influencing technology acceptance - and to do so in a representative way for all social classes.},

This study investigated local perceptions of built heritage in Erbil by assessing responses of 414 participants using a questionnaire survey aiming to identify how built heritage is perceived by the various group samples, exploring local perceptions' (in)consistencies. Significant differences were found between architects' and non-architects' perceptions and related wellbeing. As the groups attribute different values, the results suggest that heritage buildings do not contribute to the wellbeing of non-architects as much as to architects. A contradicting result was found between modern and heritage buildings. This study contributes to the notion of human-centrality of the built environment by assessing local perceptions of built heritage, that, when implemented in urban planning and heritage management, can contribute to the city's socio-cultural sustainable development.},

Exploring reasons for the choice of transport means can be a basis for interventions. In response to Andor et al. (2020) this study aimed to replicate the effect of the underestimation of the monthly vehicle's costs. Additionally, other car-related costs and reasons for the underestimation were explored. The effect of information about the actual cost on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a public transport monthly ticket, the attitudes regarding different means of transport and the estimation of car-related costs was examined. Furthermore, we wanted to learn, which reasons are relevant for the decision between car and public transport. Car users (N=147) were questioned online in a mixed-method-design containing a questionnaire and Cognitive Affective Maps. They were assigned randomly to an intervention or control group. Data was collected before and after the intervention. The underestimation effect of the monthly car costs from Andor et al. (2020) could be replicated. All other car related costs have been underestimated, too. Psychological theories providing possible reasons for this underestimation were discussed. The intervention increased the WTP for a public transport ticket and changed the attitudes towards different means of transport. The estimation for the total monthly costs and the monthly depreciation costs improved, the other estimations remained the same. It was shown that costs are a crucial factor in the decision between different means of transport. Information about the actual costs of cars could therefore contribute to changing mobility behaviour.},

To date, only a few sentences have been published, by Auspurg and Hinz, on the impact of the presentation format (text vs. table) on the answer behavior of students. Empirically, no differences were found between either format. Based on an Internet experiment conducted with a quota sample, we find evidence that ordinary tabular formats outperform text vignettes in terms of total vignette nonresponse but not when it comes to processing time. The former result especially applies in the case of less well-educated people. We further find that tabular format does not perform worse than text format regarding response inconsistency.},

  abstract = {Medium- and long-term planning, defined here as 10 years or longer, in the energy and water sectors is fraught with uncertainty, exacerbated by an accelerating `paradigm shift'. The new paradigm is characterised by a changing climate and rapid adoption of new technologies, accompanied by changes in end-use practices. Traditional methods (such as econometrics) do not incorporate these diverse and dynamic aspects and perform poorly when exploring long-term futures. This paper critiques existing methods and explores how interdisciplinary insights could provide methodological innovation for exploring future energy and water demand. The paper identifies four attributes that methods need to capture to reflect at least some of the uncertainty associated with the paradigm shift: stochastic events, the diversity of behaviour, policy interventions and the `co-evolution' of the variables affecting demand. Machine-learning methods can account for some of the four identified attributes and can be further enhanced by insights from across the psychological and social sciences (human geography and sociology), incorporating rebound effect and the unevenness of demand, and acknowledging the emergent nature of demand. The findings have implications for urban and regional planning of infrastructure and contribute to current debates on nexus thinking for energy and water resource management.},

An important research challenge is to determine how people decide to seek or avoid information. Here we propose a framework of information-seeking that aims to integrate the diverse motives that drive information-seeking and its avoidance. Our framework rests on the idea that information can alter people's action, affect and cognition in both positive and negative ways. The suggestion is that people assess these influences and integrate them into a calculation of the value of information that leads to information-seeking or avoidance. The theory offers a framework for characterizing and quantifying individual differences in information-seeking, which we hypothesize may also be diagnostic of mental health. We consider biases that can lead to both insufficient and excessive information-seeking. We also discuss how the framework can help government agencies to assess the welfare effects of mandatory information disclosure.},

  abstract = {Measures of student ethical sensitivity and their increases help to answer questions such as whether accounting ethics should be taught at all. We investigate different sensitivity measures and alternatives to the well-established Defining Issues Test (DIT-2, Rest, J. R. et al. [1999, Postconventional Moral Thinking: A Neo-Kohlbergian Approach (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ]), frequently used to measure the effects of undergraduate accounting ethics education. Because the DIT measures cognitive development, which increases with age, the DIT scores for younger accounting students are typically lower, have limited range, and are not likely to vary sufficiently with corresponding choices in ethical dilemmas. Since the DIT measures only the moral judgment component of ethical decision-making, we consider the multidimensional ethical scale (MES) to allow respondents to provide explanations for their moral and other judgments. The MES has been used to measure attitudes related to justice, utility, contractualism, egoism, and relativism. Unfortunately, the MES is not comparable in one-dimension to the DIT, and unlike the DIT, the MES has no theoretical or objective base. Therefore, we construct a comparable one-dimensional relative measure, a Composite MES Score, obtained from previous research on practicing accountants. We compare the reliability of this measure to the DIT in explaining the ethical choices of 54 specially chosen, somewhat homogeneous students, whose ages range from 18 to 19, and who are taking a second semester freshman accounting course at a private, religion-affiliated university. These particular students are relatively untrained in the formal use of questionable accounting choices. These students are less likely to recognize the dilemmas of the MES and are also less likely to demonstrate sufficient variation in their DIT scores, traditionally low for freshmen students. As freshmen, they are recent graduates of high school and more likely guided by other ethical influences including friends, family, or contractual obligations (some of the MES constructs) rather than higher cognitive development. This study confirms suspicions. We find the DIT scores do not vary sufficiently to explain the moral reasoning of freshmen. For eight dilemmas and 24 choices we find the DIT score correlates with only three choices, whereas the MES regression models have at least one significant construct for 23 out of 24 ethical choices. The Composite MES Score (a relative measure) also explains 23 out of 24 choices and is statistically related to the DIT in only one of the choices. Unlike the DIT, the Composite MES permits pretest and retesting with different dilemmas to evaluate changes in ethical sensitivity. These results argue for relative rather than absolute measures of sensitivity and guides beyond cognitive development (the DIT-score) to explain undergraduate student sensitivity.},

Efforts to address climate change have primarily focused on mitigation, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and more recently on addressing the impacts of climate change\textemdash adaptation. However, international political consensus on the need to reduce emissions has been very slow in coming, and there is as yet no agreement on the emissions reductions needed beyond 2012. As a result global emissions have continued to increase by about 3\% per year (Raupach et al. 2007), a faster rate than that projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (IPCC 2001)7 even under its most fossil fuel intensive scenario (A1FI8) in which an increase in global mean temperature of about 4\textdegree C (2.4 to 6.4\textdegree C) by 2100 is projected (Rahmstorf et al. 2007). The scientifi c community is now becoming increasingly concerned that emissions will not be reduced at the rate and magnitude required to keep the increase in global average temperature below 2\textdegree C (above pre-industrial levels) by 2100. Concerns with the lack of progress of the political processes have led to increasing interest in geoengineering approaches. This Royal Society report presents an independent scientifi c review of the range of methods proposed with the aim of providing an objective view on whether geoengineering could, and should, play a role in addressing climate change, and under what conditions.},

We conducted a mail survey in the German-speaking part of Switzerland (N = 1,065). Results suggested that cultural worldviews and climate-related knowledge were significantly related with people's concern about climate change. Also, cultural worldviews and climate-relevant knowledge appeared important for people's willingness to change behaviors and to accept climate change policies. In addition, different types of knowledge were found to have different impacts on people's concern about climate change, their willingness to change behaviors, and their acceptance of policies about climate change. Specifically, causal knowledge significantly increased concern about climate change and willingness to support climate-friendly policies. We therefore concluded that risk communication should focus on causal knowledge, provided this knowledge does not threaten cultural values.},

The expectation is that most statistically significant findings can be replicated in new data and in new laboratories, but in practice many findings have replicated less often than expected, leading to claims of a replication crisis. We review recent methodological literature on questionable research practices, meta-analysis, and power analysis to explain the apparently high rates of failure to replicate. Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability. We recommend that researchers adopt open science conventions of preregi-stration and full disclosure and that replication efforts be based on multiple studies rather than on a single replication attempt. We call for more sophisticated power analyses, careful consideration of the various influences on effect sizes, and more complete disclosure of nonsignificant as well as statistically significant findings.},

In this narrative Review, we organize the research describing how heuristics and individual differences among consumers influence the acceptance of agri-food technologies. Associations evoked by a food technology, its perceived naturalness and trust in the industry using it influence consumer acceptance. Food neophobia, disgust sensitivity and cultural values are crucial personality factors for explaining individual differences. Using gene technology, nanotechnology, cultured meat and food irradiation as cases, we explore factors that may explain consumers' acceptance or lack of acceptance. Climate change, food supply shocks caused by crises such as pandemics and population growth are imminent threats to the food system. Therefore, disruptive food technologies will be needed to progress towards a more resilient food system. Taking into account the factors influencing consumers' perceptions of novel food technologies during the early stage of development and introduction will hopefully result in a higher acceptance of such technologies.},

The postulated model was tested using structural equation modeling procedures and data from a random quota sample of 1001 Swiss citizens between 18 and 74 years old. Results indicated that the proposed model fits the data very well. The same causal model explains females' and males' acceptance of gene technology. Gender differences were found for the latent variables trust, perceived benefit, and acceptance of gene technology. Females indicated more trust, perceived less benefit, and demonstrated less acceptance than did males. No significant difference was observed for perceived risk.

In making these distinctions, we also highlight what we see as outstanding challenges for researchers and practitioners.

In the present analysis we use the tools of network science, a set of mathematical techniques to examine the relationships between entities in a system, to create networks from the items in the Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS), a widely used instrument to measure statistics anxiety. Separate networks were constructed and analyzed for students who were high or low in statistics anxiety. The items in the STARS were the nodes in the network, with connections placed between nodes if responses to those 2 items in the STARS were correlated. The network analysis revealed differences in the overall structure of high- and low-anxiety networks and in which nodes were most 'important' in the 2 groups, suggesting that different interventions might be required depending on the level of statistics anxiety experienced by the student. Furthermore, our results suggest that the most effective interventions for students with very high levels of statistics anxiety would need to specifically address the (incorrect) perception that strong mathematical ability is a necessary prerequisite for excelling in statistics. Centrally located nodes in the network may help instructors appropriately target classroom interventions to help all students succeed regardless of the level of statistical anxiety experienced by students.

Second, in practice, alpha is used more often as a measure of the test's internal consistency than as an estimate of reliability. However, it can be shown easily that alpha is unrelated to the internal structure of the test. It is further discussed that statistics based on a single test administration do not convey much information about the accuracy of individuals' test performance.

He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election.~Silver is the founder and editor in chief~of the website FiveThirtyEight.~ ~Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the ``prediction paradox'': The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball to global pandemics, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good\textemdash or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary\textemdash and dangerous\textemdash science.Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver's insights are an essential read.},

The chapter discusses how to set up a mixed model and how to perform statistical inference with a mixed model. The most important concept for understanding how to estimate and how to interpret mixed models is the distinction between fixed and random effects. One important characteristic of mixed models is that they allow random effects for multiple, possibly independent, random effects grouping factors. Mixed models are a modern class of statistical models that extend regular regression models by including random-effects parameters to account for dependencies among related data points.},

Although latent variables have widely different interpretations in different settings, the models have a very similar mathematical structure. This has been the impetus for the formulation of general modelling frameworks which accommodate a wide range of models. Recent developments include multilevel structural equation models with both continuous and discrete latent variables, multiprocess models and nonlinear latent variable models.},

As used here, ``affect'' means the specific quality of ``goodness'' or ``badness'' (i) experienced as a feeling state (with or without consciousness) and (ii) demarcating a positive or negative quality of a stimulus. Affective responses occur rapidly and automatically\textemdash note how quickly you sense the feelings associated with the stimulus word ``treasure'' or the word ``hate''. We argue that reliance on such feelings can be characterized as ``the affect heuristic''. In this paper we trace the development of the affect heuristic across a variety of research paths followed by ourselves and many others. We also discuss some of the important practical implications resulting from ways that this heuristic impacts our daily lives.},

These "preference reversals" violate the principle of procedure invariance that is fundamental to theories of rational choice and raise difficult questions about the nature of human values. If different elicitation procedures produce different orderings of options, how can preferences be defined and in what sense do they exist? Describing and explaining such failures of invariance will require choice models of far greater complexity than the traditional models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

He also examines the elements of knowledge, cognitive skill, and communication necessary for good decisions in the face of risk. The first section of the book looks at the difficulty of understanding risk without an emotional component, for example that disaster statistics lack emotion and thus fail to convey the true meaning of disasters and fail to motivate proper action to prevent them. The book also highlights other important perspectives on risk arising from cultural worldviews and concerns about specific hazards pertaining to blood transfusion, biotechnology, prescription drugs, smoking, terrorism, and nanotechnology. Following on from The Perception of Risk (2000), this book presents some of the most significant research on risk perception in recent years, providing essential lessons for all those involved in risk perception and communication.},

Second, the TSE/TSMV typology needs to be as detailed and comprehensive as possible. Third, TSE needs to be thought of as heavily involving the interaction of error components and the concept of comparison error should be used to extend TSE to cover multiple survey types. Fourth, the minimizing of TSE is an important goal in survey research and the TSE paradigm can be used as both an applied application and a research agenda to achieve that goal. Finally, TSE has both individual and aggregate components and an absolute and situational aspect. The role of each of these needs to be kept in mind.},

Although uncertainty is a fundamental feature of complex technologies, its importance has not yet been fully recognized within the field of ethics. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to study uncertainty in technology development and its consequences for ethics. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Going on the insight of various scientific disciplines, the concept of uncertainty will be scrutinised and a typology of uncertainty is proposed and introduced to ethical theory. The method used is theoretical and conceptual analysis. Findings \textendash{} The analysis results in questions with regard to the collection of information about the object of assessment (i.e. complex technologies and their development) and the framework of assessment (i.e. ethical theory and its practical aim of guiding the assessment of technology development). Moreover, based on the insights of the analysis of uncertainty, it is argued that substantive ethical theories prove to be inapt for the ethical assessment of complex technology development and therefore require a concomitant procedural approach. The paper concludes with requirements for any future ethics of technology under uncertainty. Originality/value \textendash{} The value of the paper consists in establishing the need of researching and incorporating uncertainty in ethics. The results are consequently of practical and theoretical interest for anyone working in the field of ethics and technology.},

Technology is in- uential on society; technological innovations act upon the perception of ourselves, the world, and our relation with fellow humans and other objects. Technology is changing everything we do by creating new entities (such as software, nanop- ticles, or Internet), by changing the scale of activities (e. g. vast amounts of data about people can be stored and analysed, and not infrequently without people - ing aware of this), by generating new kinds of knowledge (for instance about i- nesses, the human genome and so on). Technologies, as a consequence, impinge upon our morality and for this reason an ethics of technology should not wait passively until moral problems arise and not only focus on identi ed and exi- ing moral problems, but contemplate technology developments and possible - pacts proactively. However, this is easier said than done, because a prospective and proactive evaluation of technology developments is complicated by complexity and uncertainty. The uncertainty of technology development is closely related to one of the str- ing features of technology, namely what Jim Moor has coined logical malleability. (1985, 269) Technological devices are logically malleable in that they can be shaped to do any activity that can be characterised in terms of logical operations.},

We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with prognostic carbon cycle to compare solar radiation management (SRM) by stratospheric sulfur injection and two carbon dioxide removal methods: afforestation and ocean alkalinization. The CE model experiments are designed to offset the effect of fossil-fuel burning on global mean surface air temperature under the RCP8.5 scenario to follow or get closer to the RCP4.5 scenario. Our results show the importance of feedbacks in the CE effects. For example, as a response to SRM the land carbon uptake is enhanced by 92 Gt by the year 2100 compared to the reference RCP8.5 scenario due to reduced soil respiration thus reducing atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we show that normalizations allow for a better comparability of different CE methods. For example, we find that due to compensating processes such as biogeophysical effects of afforestation more carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere by afforestation than by alkalinization to reach the same global warming reduction. Overall, we illustrate how different CE methods affect the components of the Earth system; we identify challenges arising in a CE comparison, and thereby contribute to developing a framework for a comparative assessment of CE.},

Personality traits are well suited for this purpose. Because no recent work has systematically combined the accumulating evidence on this topic, we aimed to meta-analyze the associations of the Big Five and HEXACO personality domains with proenvironmental attitudes and behaviors. A meta-analysis of 38 sources (N = 44,993) implicated openness and honesty-humility as the strongest correlates of proenvironmental attitudes (r = .22 and .20) and behaviors (r = .21 and .25). Agreeableness, conscientiousness, and, to a lesser extent, extraversion were also associated with proenvironmental attitudes (r = .15, .12, and .09) and behaviors (r = .10, .11, and .10). Heterogeneity among effect sizes was partly explained by samples? gender ratio, age, and country of origin and by the personality model. P-curve analyses, funnel plots, and Egger?s tests indicated significant but sporadic and small publication bias. As a validity test, the meta-analytic associations collectively provided substantial predictive accuracy for proenvironmental attitudes (r = .44?.45) and behaviors (r = .28?.43) in independent holdout samples.},

  abstract = {The work within this dissertation primarily focused on what types of people do (not)   care or act pro-environmentally and examined potential mechanisms for promoting pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours. Chapter 1 provided an initial introduction to this   topic and the disciplines of environmental and conservation psychology. It presented the  history of research, the current state of research, and the contribution of individual   differences on understanding pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours.  The first part of this dissertation concerned itself with the measurement of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours. In Chapter 2, the factor structure of two new pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours measures were assessed, which resulted in two   unidimensional measures. These two measures were found to be associated with an existing   measure of pro-environmental behaviours, demonstrating their predictive and concurrent   validity respectively. In Chapter 3, the test-retest reliability, internal consistency, predictive   validity for pro-environmental behaviours, and concurrent validity of the newly created pro-environmental attitudes measure were assessed. Furthermore, the concurrent validity of the   newly created pro-environmental behaviours measure was further assessed. These new   measures demonstrated acceptable concurrent validity. Furthermore, the new measure of pro-environmental attitudes demonstrated acceptable to good test-retest reliability, internal   consistency, and predictive validity for pro-environmental behaviours on par with existing   measures of pro-environmental attitudes. Lastly, this chapter identified several existing   measures of pro-environmental attitudes that had acceptable to good test-retest reliability,   internal consistency, and predictive validity for pro-environmental behaviours. This formed   the basis of measurement for future chapters.  The second part of this dissertation concerned itself with how personality was  associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours, and how this could be used to   inform effective interventions. In Chapter 4, a meta-analysis was conducted that assessed  how the personality domains of the Big Five and HEXACO were associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours. The meta-analysis of 38 sources, implicated   Openness and Honesty-Humility as the strongest correlates of pro-environmental attitudes   and behaviours. Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and to a lesser extent Extraversion were   also associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours. Neuroticism was not   associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours. Furthermore, the meta-analytic   associations, collectively, provided substantial predictive accuracy for pro-environmental   attitudes and behaviours. Chapter 5 expanded on this and examined how personality at a   facet-level, rather than domain-level, was associated with pro-environmental attitudes and   behaviours. Using two datasets (N = 501 and 287) certain facets were identified as the main   drivers of domain-level associations. Furthermore, these facet-level associations accurately   predicted pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours, on par with domain-level associations.   The third part of this dissertation concerned itself with how political preferences were  associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours, and how this could be used to   inform effective interventions. In Chapter 6, a replication of a study conducted by Schuldt,   Konrath, and Schwarz (2011) was conducted. This replication assessed whether there was an   interaction between question wording and political preferences on pro-environmental beliefs.   In this pre-registered large cross-country study (United States of America, United Kingdom,   and Australia; N = 5,717), it was found that the previously reported interaction between   question wording and political preferences no longer existed. However, it was consistently   found that Conservatives were less likely to believe in climate change/global warming when   compared to Liberals. Chapter 7 expanded on this and examined various operationalisations   of political preferences, the potential confound of personality, and how political preferences   might be associated with a range of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours. This study   (N = 499) replicated the finding that Conservatives were less likely to believe in climate   change/global warming than Liberals, regardless of how political preferences were  operationalised. The interaction between political preferences and question wording on pro-environmental beliefs occurred when political preferences were operationalised as  continuously measured political orientation, but in the opposite direction to Schuldt and   colleagues (2011). Furthermore, this interaction did not exist when political preferences were  operationalised as party voted for. Personality traits did not confound these effects.   Furthermore, political orientation was associated with pro-environmental attitudes and   behaviours, when controlling for personality traits. The personality domains of Openness,   Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness were associated with pro-environmental attitudes and  behaviours when controlling for political preferences (regardless of operationalisation).  However, political preferences were no longer associated with pro-environmental behaviours,   and Agreeableness was inconsistently associated with these behaviours, when the   demographic variables of age, gender, area, income, and education were also controlled for.  Lastly, in Chapter 8 a summary of the previous chapters' results and their   contextualisation in the wider literature was presented. Furthermore, the future directions of   research on pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours, and in particular, the role of   individual differences in this research was explored.},

It has not systematically examined the prospective co-impacts of carbon removal (or negative emissions) and solar geoengineering. Based on a large sample of diverse expert interviews (N~=~125), and using a sociotechnical approach, in this study we identify 107 perceived co-impacts related to the deployment of carbon removal and solar geoengineering technologies. Slightly less than half (52) were identified as positive co-impacts (38 for carbon removal, 14 for solar geoengineering), whereas slightly more than half (55) were identified as negative co-impacts (31 for carbon removal, 24 for solar geoengineering). We then discuss 20 of these co-impacts in more depth, including positive co-impacts for nature-based protection, the expansion of industry, and reduction of poverty or heat stress as well as negative co-impacts for water insecurity, moral hazard, limited social acceptance and path dependence. After presenting this body of evidence, the paper then discusses and theorizes these co-impacts more deeply in terms of four areas: relationality and risk-risk trade-offs, co-deployment and coupling, intentional or unintentional implications, and expert consensus and dissensus. It concludes with more general insights for energy and climate research, and policy.},

  abstract = {Negative emissions technologies and solar radiation management techniques could contribute towards climate stability, either by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it permanently or reflecting sunlight away from the atmosphere. Despite concerns about them, such options are increasingly being discussed as crucial complements to traditional climate change mitigation and adaptation. Expectations around negative emissions and solar radiation management and their associated risks and costs shape public and private discussions of how society deals with the climate crisis. In this study, we rely on a large expert survey (N\,=\,74) to critically examine the future potential of both negative emission options (e.g., carbon dioxide removal) and solar radiation management techniques. We designed a survey process that asked a pool of prominent experts questions about (i) the necessity of adopting negative emissions or solar radiation management options, (ii) the desirability of such options when ranked against each other, (iii) estimations of future efficacy in terms of temperature reductions achieved or gigatons of carbon removed, (iv) expectations about future scaling, commercialization, and deployment targets, and (v) potential risks and barriers. Unlike other elicitation processes where experts are more positive or have high expectations about novel options, our results are more critical and cautionary. We find that some options (notably afforestation and reforestation, ecosystem restoration, and soil carbon sequestration) are envisioned frequently as necessary, desirable, feasible, and affordable, with minimal risks and barriers (compared to other options). This contrasts with other options envisaged as unnecessary risky or costly, notably ocean alkalization or fertilization, space-based reflectors, high-altitude sunshades, and albedo management via clouds. Moreover, only the options of afforestation and reforestation and soil carbon sequestration are expected to be widely deployed before 2035, which raise very real concerns about climate and energy policy in the near- to mid-term.},

Admittedly, defining scenario has been a challenge. Current practice, which results in repeated attempts to clarify said confusion with yet another new definition of scenario, has apparently not advanced the field. An alternative option is not to redefine scenario, but to, instead, create a shared definition composed of component parts of pre-existing definitions. The result is an operant or synthesized definition based on analysis of claims indicating what ``a scenario is\ldots '' and ``scenarios are\ldots '' in the literature on scenario planning. The authors find that scenarios have a temporal property rooted in the future and reference external forces in that context; scenarios should be possible and plausible while taking the proper form of a story or narrative description; and that scenarios exist in sets that are systematically prepared to coexist as meaningful alternatives to one another. Despite claims to the contrary, the authors find that the academic community of futures and foresight science does not seem to suffer from so-called confusion over the definition of scenario, and thus, it is time to sunset the use of claims to this end.},

Since it became possible to change the quality of the boundary between living and technical systems, more and more life-like technical products have been developed in recent years. Using five plant-inspired developments of motile technical systems for architecture and soft-robotics, we show how the boundary between living and technical systems undulates, shifts, perforates, blurs, or dissolves with increasing life-likeness. We discuss what causes theses changes in the boundary and how this contributes to the overall aim to achieve higher resilience, robustness, and improved esthetics of plant-inspired products. Inspiration from living systems that make efficient and economic use of materials and energy and are fully recyclable after ``service time'' may additionally contribute to sustainable material use, one of the major challenges in the Anthropocene.},

Moreover, the development of biomimetic products helps to improve our understanding of biological concept generators (reverse biomimetics). What does this mean for the education of kindergarten children, pupils, students, teachers, and others interested in biomimetics? The challenge of biomimetics is to have a solid knowledge base in the scientific disciplines involved and the competency to be open-minded enough to develop innovative solutions. This apparently contradictory combination ensures the transfer of knowledge from biology to engineering and vice versa on the basis of a common language that is perfectly understandable to everyone, e.g., the language of models, algorithms, and complete mathematical formulations. The opportunity within biomimetics is its ability to arouse student interest in technology via the fascination inherent in biological solutions and to awaken enthusiasm for living nature via the understanding of technology. Collaboration in working groups promotes professional, social, and personal skills. The variety of biomimetics is mirrored by the large number of educational modules developed with respect to existing biomimetic products and methods.},

However, plants show a great variety of movements exclusively based on elastic deformation of regions within their moving organs. The absence of gliding parts, as found in the joints of vertebrates and insects, prevents stress concentration and attrition. Since plants have no central control unit (brain), stimulus-sensing, decision-making and reaction usually take place noncentrally in the hierarchically structured materials systems of the moving organs, in what can be regarded as an example of physical intelligence. These characteristics make plants interesting models for a new group of soft robots and soft machines that differ fundamentally from those inspired by animals. The potential of such plant-inspired soft robots and machines is shown in six examples and is illustrated by examples applied in architecture and medicine.},

Analyses of public perceptions have indicated that climate change is perceived as distant on a number of different dimensions. However, to date there has been no in-depth exploration of the psychological distance of climate change. This study uses a nationally representative British sample in order to systematically explore and characterize each of the four theorized dimensions of psychological distance\textemdash temporal, social, and geographical distance, and uncertainty\textemdash in relation to climate change. We examine how each of these different aspects of psychological distance relate to each other as well as to concerns about climate change and sustainable behavior intentions. Results indicate that climate change is both psychologically distant and proximal in relation to different dimensions. Lower psychological distance was generally associated with higher levels of concern, although perceived impacts on developing countries, as an indicator of social distance, was also significantly related to preparedness to act on climate change. Our findings clearly point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance. However, highlighting the potentially very serious distant impacts of climate change may also be useful in promoting sustainable behavior, even among those already concerned.},

For this reason, explicit attention is paid in the first chapters to mathematical notations and proof techniques, emphasizing that the notations form the biggest obstacle, not the mathematical concepts themselves. This approach allows to gradually prepare students for using tools that are necessary to put graph theory to work: complex networks.In the second part of the book the student learns about random networks, small worlds, the structure of the Internet and the Web, peer-to-peer systems, and social networks. Again, everything is discussed at an elementary level, but such that in the end students indeed have the feeling that they:1.Have learned how to read and understand the basic mathematics related to graph theory.2.Understand how basic graph theory can be applied to optimization problems such as routing in communication networks.3.Know a bit more about this sometimes mystical field of small worlds and random networks.There is an accompanying web site www.distributed-systems.net/gtcn from where supplementary material can be obtained, including exercises, Mathematica notebooks, data for analyzing graphs, and generators for various complex networks.},

Although global-scale human influence on the environment has been recognized since the 1800s, the term Anthropocene, introduced about a decade ago, has only recently become widely, but informally, used in the global change research community. However, the term has yet to be accepted formally as a new geological epoch or era in Earth history. In this paper, we put forward the case for formally recognizing the Anthropocene as a new epoch in Earth history, arguing that the advent of the Industrial Revolution around 1800 provides a logical start date for the new epoch. We then explore recent trends in the evolution of the Anthropocene as humanity proceeds into the twenty-first century, focusing on the profound changes to our relationship with the rest of the living world and on early attempts and proposals for managing our relationship with the large geophysical cycles that drive the Earth's climate system.},

In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy (OECD) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However, the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since 1950 has been in the non-OECD world but the world's economy (GDP), and hence consumption, is still strongly dominated by the OECD world. The Earth System indicators, in general, continued their long-term, post-industrial rise, although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric ozone loss, showed a slowing or apparent stabilisation over the past decade. The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.},

  abstract = {Public transport is often perceived to be a poor alternative for car use. This paper describes who may be open to use public transport more often, and how people might be persuaded to use it. A computerised questionnaire study was conducted among 1,803 Dutch respondents in May 2001. Results revealed that especially fervent car users disliked public transport. For them, the car outperformed public transport not only because of its instrumental function, but also because the car represents cultural and psychological values, e.g. the car is a symbol of freedom and independence, a status symbol and driving is pleasurable. So, for fervent car users, car use is connected with various important values in modern society. Infrequent car users judged less positively about the car and less negatively about public transport. Consequently, they may be open to use public transport more regularly. In contrast, many efforts are needed to stimulate fervent car users to travel by public transport, because in their view, public transport cannot compete with their private car. In this case, policies should be aimed at reducing the functional, psychological and cultural values of private cars, as well as increasing the performance of public transport and other (more) environmentally sound modes of transport on these aspects.},

  abstract = {This paper reports results of two questionnaire studies aimed at examining various motives for car use. In the first study, a random selection of 185 respondents who possess a driving licence were interviewed. Respondents were recruited from the cities of Groningen and Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The sample of the second study comprised a random selection of 113 commuters who regularly travelled during rush hours in and around Rotterdam, a region in the west of the Netherlands. First, it was examined which categories of car use motives may be distinguished. As proposed by Dittmar's (1992) [The social psychology of material possessions: to have is to be. Havester Wheatsheaf, Hemel Hempstead, UK; St. Martin's Press, New York] model on the meaning of material possessions, results from both studies revealed that car use not only fulfils instrumental functions, but also important symbolic and affective functions. Second, it was studied to what extent these different motives are related to the level of car use. From the results of study 2, it appeared that commuter car use was most strongly related to symbolic and affective motives, and not to instrumental motives. Third, individual differences in the relative importance of the three categories of motives were investigated. In both studies, most group differences were found in the evaluation of the symbolic and affective motives (and not the instrumental ones). Especially frequent drivers, respondents with a positive car attitude, male and younger respondents valued these non-instrumental motives for car use. These results suggest that policy makers should not exclusively focus on instrumental motives for car use, but they should consider the many social and affective motives as well.},

Because the threats of transgressing planetary boundaries are global, long-run, uncertain and interconnected, they must be analysed together to avoid conflicts and take advantage of synergies. To obtain policies that are effective at both international and local levels requires careful analysis of the underlying mechanisms across scientific disciplines and approaches, and must take politics into account. In this Perspective, we examine the complexities of designing policies that can keep Earth within the biophysical limits favourable to human life.},

Drawing on theoretical work on values and norm-activation processes, we propose a value-belief-norm (VBN) theory of movement support. Individuals who accept a movement's basic values, believe that valued objects are threatened, and believe that their actions can help restore those values experience an obligation (personal norm) for pro-movement action that creates a predisposition to provide support; the particular type of support that results is dependent on the individual's capabilities and constraints. Data from a national survey of 420 respondents suggest that the VBN theory, when compared with other prevalent theories, offers the best available account of support for the environmental movement.},

Some evidence suggests that vaccine hesitancy in Europe may be linked with the success of populist parties, but more systematic analysis is needed.We examine the prevalence of individual-level vaccine hesitancy across the European Union (EU) and its association with political orientations. We also analyze whether success of populist parties is linked with vaccine hesitancy and uptake. We draw on individual-level Eurobarometer data from 2019, with a total of 27~524 respondents across the EU. We also rely on national and regional-level populist party vote shares. Finally, for a time-series analysis, we rely on aggregated populist party support as measured in the European Social Survey waves 1\textendash 9 (2002\textendash 18), and national immunization coverage rates from the WHO from 2002 to 2018.While vaccine hesitancy is confined to a minority of the population, this group is large enough to risk herd immunity. Political orientations on a left-right dimension are not strongly linked to vaccine hesitancy. Instead, vaccine hesitancy is associated with anti-elite world views and culturally closed rather than cosmopolitan positions.Vaccine hesitancy is not only present in all EU member states but also maps on broader dimensions of cultural conflict. Hesitancy is rooted in a broader worldview, rather than misperceptions about health risks. Pro-vaccine interventions need to consider the underlying worldview, rather than simply targeting misperceptions.},

Since the 1970s, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison.

However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines.

  abstract = {Climate engineering has received increasing attention, but its discussion has remained on the sidelines of mainstream climate policy. The policy relevance of this previously exotic option is poised to rise because of the gap between the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement and slow global mitigation efforts. It is therefore crucial to understand the risks and benefits of the proposed schemes, and the social implications of policy choices. Assessment of the risks and benefits of solar geoengineering strongly depends on scenarios, but previous scenarios have not reflected the full range of social choices. In light of concerns over risks, a newer set of scenarios is desirable, which represents both uncertainties and social choices more fully. Borrowing and extending lessons from recent literature on the new community climate scenario process, we envision a possible scenario-building process that combines interdisciplinary scholarship with the involvement of stakeholders and citizens. The resultant scenarios would better characterize uncertainties of, and policy choices for, solar geoengineering, and foster critical appraisal of its risks and benefits. Such societal choices might include not only total ban and large-scale deployment, but also limited deployment, which has received less attention in the scenario literature. The interaction between scenario and governance research would be able to highlight the central issues at stake, including ethical, social, and political dimensions.Key policy insightsA more comprehensive assessment of solar geoengineering is necessary to evaluate its risks and benefits, necessitating new scenario researchIt is crucial to reflect the full span of policy choices and uncertainties with interdisciplinary collaboration in such scenariosSuch societal choices might include not only total ban and large-scale deployment, but also limited deployment, which has received less attention in the scenario literatureParticipatory scenario research would enable incorporating the concerns and opinions of stakeholders and citizens in scenario creation},

  abstract = {Solar radiation management (SRM) is a controversial technological proposal to deliberately cool the Earth for addressing climate change. Because of great concerns over global consequences of SRM deployment, an inclusive and global conversation is considered necessary for the governance of SRM. However, public perception research on SRM to date has been mostly limited to the Global North or Western democracy. Because social acceptability is crucial for SRM governance, such research must also encompass the Global South or Eastern perspectives beyond the Western bias. The present study conducted an online survey of college students in six Asia-Pacific countries (Australia, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea) about their attitudes toward stratospheric aerosol geoengineering, one of most discussed SRM proposals. Our results showed that students from the Global South (China, India, the Philippines) were more willing to accept geoengineering as a potential option than those from the Global North (Australia, Japan, and South Korea). We also found an overwhelming consensus in support of geoengineering governance principles such as information disclosure and pre-deployment regulation across all six countries. Our results suggest that more nuanced and granular understandings of non-Western perspectives are critical to enable inclusive democratic debate on geoengineering governance.},

However, soft robotics is a promising field that has not yet been leveraged by SAR design. Soft robotics is the incorporation of smart materials to achieve biomimetic motions, active deformations, and responsive sensing. By utilizing these distinctive characteristics, a new type of SAR can be developed that has the potential to be safer to interact with, more flexible, and uniquely uses novel interaction modes (colors/shapes) to engage in a heighted human\textendash robot interaction. In this perspective article, we coin this new collaborative research area as SoftSAR. We provide extensive discussions on just how soft robotics can be utilized to positively impact SARs, from their actuation mechanisms to the sensory designs, and how valuable they will be in informing future SAR design and applications. With extensive discussions on the fundamental mechanisms of soft robotic technologies, we outline a number of key SAR research areas that can benefit from using unique soft robotic mechanisms, which will result in the creation of the new field of SoftSAR.},

  abstract = {Different geoengineering strategies have been proposed to fight climate change, and they are increasingly attracting the interest of scholars and policy-makers. However, public perception and acceptance will be crucial for the implementation of these technological approaches, such as solar radiation management (SRM). In the present study, we used an experimental approach to examine factors influencing laypeople's perception of SRM and how information about SRM shapes people's evaluation of geoengineering technologies. Participants (N = 250) were randomly assigned to one of three information conditions. The control group did not receive any specific information about SRM but was only informed that technologies existed for fighting climate change. The participants in the experimental groups received a short explanation of SRM, either with or without mentioning possible risks associated with this technological approach. Results indicate that a mere description of the technology already reduces support for technological solutions to fight climate change. This finding poses a serious challenge to researchers interested in convincing the public to accept experiments related to SRM. Analyses of the factors influencing perception and evaluation of geoengineering technologies revealed that, in the control group, the affect associated with climate change exerted a significant impact on the affective\textendash cognitive evaluation of geoengineering technologies. However, this was not the case in the experimental groups. This means, the participants who received information about SRM did not rely on affective responses regarding climate change. Finally, results of mediation analyses showed that providing information resulted in a different affective\textendash cognitive evaluation of geoengineering technologies that, subsequently, influenced people's assessment of the benefits and risks associated with geoengineering technologies.},

The resulting place sustainability scale (PSS) is a practical and useful tool for place administrators to measure place sustainability at all scales. Design/methodology/approach This research analyses the data collected from 636 residents in the town of Salaya in Central Thailand. To develop the scale, the authors randomise 318 samples to conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and analyse the rest with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Findings A total of 11 factors of place sustainability were generated with 33 questionnaire items. Those factors were natural environment, social equity, economic growth, built environment, landscape, liveability, conviviality, transport, energy, water and waste management and governance. Practical implications The PSS can help place administrators, such as chief executives of sub-districts, mayors of town municipalities or governors of provinces, assess perceived sustainability from the perspectives of their residents. They can use this scale in conjunction with other sustainability indicators that calculate data from real variables and values to develop a comprehensive view of sustainability that includes both real and perceptual dimensions. Originality/value Numerous available indices and indicators use real variables and values to measure place sustainability. However, they have limitations: they can be complex and incomprehensible to outsiders or they might not support participative processes and policymaking. This research develops an alternative measure of place sustainability that assesses the perceptions of residents.},

  abstract = {Through their anisotropic cellular mesostructure and differential swelling and shrinking properties, hygroscopic plant structures move in response to changes in the environment without consuming metabolic energy. When the movement is choreographed in sequential time steps, either in individual structures or with a coordinated interplay of various structural elements, complex functionalities such as dispersal and protection of seeds are achieved. Inspired by the multi-phase motion in plant structures, this paper presents a method to physically program the timescale and the sequences of shape-change in 4D-printed hygromorphic structures. Using the FDM 3D-printing method, we have developed multi-layered, multi-material functional bilayers that combine highly hygroscopic active layers (printed with hygroscopic bio-composite materials) with hydrophobic restrictive and blocking layers (printed with PLA and TPC materials). The timescale of motion is programmed through the design of the mesostructured layers and 3D-printing process parameters, including thickness (number of printed active layers), porosity (filling ratio of the active layer), and water permeability (filling ratio of the blocking layer). Through a series of experiments, it is shown that the timescale of motion can be extended by increasing the thickness of the active layer, decreasing the porosity of the active layer, or increasing the filling ratio of the hydrophobic restrictive and blocking layers. Similarly, a lower thickness of the active layer and lower filling ratio of all layers result in a faster motion. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate several prototypes that exhibit sequential motion, including an aperture with overlapping elements where each completes its movement sequentially to avoid collision, and a self-locking mechanism where defined areas of the structure are choreographed to achieve a multi-step self-shaping and locking function. The presented method extends the programmability and the functional capabilities of hygromorphic 4D-printing, allowing for novel applications across fields such as robotics, smart actuators, and adaptive architecture.},

However, many phenomena from division of labor to protein-protein interactions (PPI) are driven by complementarity (differences and synergy). Here we show that the principle of complementarity is linked to the abundance of quadrangles (4-cycles) and dense bipartite-like subgraphs. We link both principles to their characteristic motifs and introduce two families of coefficients of: (1)~structural similarity, which generalize local clustering and closure coefficients and capture the full spectrum of similarity-driven structures; (2)~structural complementarity, defined analogously but based on quadrangles instead of triangles. Using multiple social and biological networks, we demonstrate that the coefficients capture structural properties related to meaningful domain-specific phenomena. We show that they allow distinguishing between different kinds of social relations as well as measuring an increasing structural diversity of PPI networks across the tree of life. Our results indicate that some types of relations are better explained by complementarity than homophily, and may be useful for improving existing link prediction methods. We also introduce a Python package implementing efficient algorithms for calculating the proposed coefficients.},

  abstract = {Geoengineering could remake environments and societies, and early governance can help to steer the development of technologies towards sustainable outcomes. In the absence of observational data, geoengineering research and discussions are increasingly informed by scenarios, which provide heuristic tools for `envisioning' potential futures. Although designed for specific research goals, scenarios can have broader implications by influencing expectations about the societal role that emerging geoengineering technologies can play. Yet the design of geoengineering scenarios has gone largely unscrutinized. This study is a meta-analysis in which we evaluate geoengineering scenarios from the literature to identify emerging expectations and assess these in the context of sustainability science. We find that geoengineering scenarios can be classified into three types based on purpose and use: for scientific knowledge-building; as `structured conversation' starters; or as exploratory research tools. The first category dominates the literature; these scenarios stem from physical science disciplines where scientific tradition dictates simplification and standardization, both of which may provide misleading images of the future and therefore hinder robust decision-making. In contrast, scenarios used as exploratory tools depict not one single image of why and how geoengineering might evolve, but many. Analysis of these exploratory scenarios reveal expectations that a geoengineered future may hinge on at least four key elements\textemdash the potential for a universal geoengineering agreement, public perceptions of geoengineering, technical controllability, and the severity of climate impacts. These elements were not studied in the scientific knowledge-building scenarios, suggesting the need for an additional category of scenarios. Aligning with concepts of sustainability science, new geoengineering scenario exercises would merge participatory practices of exploratory scenarios with deterministic practices of technical scientific scenarios.},

In this work, we contribute to the effort of comparing the different methods for comparing networks and providing a guide for the selection of an appropriate one. First, we review and classify a collection of network comparison methods, highlighting the criteria they are based on and their advantages and drawbacks. The set includes methods requiring known node-correspondence, such as DeltaCon and Cut Distance, as well as methods not requiring a priori known node-correspondence, such as alignment-based, graphlet-based, and spectral methods, and the recently proposed Portrait Divergence and NetLSD. We test the above methods on synthetic networks and we assess their usability and the meaningfulness of the results they provide. Finally, we apply the methods to two real-world datasets, the European Air Transportation Network and the FAO Trade Network, in order to discuss the results that can be drawn from this type of analysis.},

Rekindled interest in soft robots is partially associated with the advances in manufacturing techniques that enable the fabrication of sophisticated multi-material robotic bodies with dimensions ranging across multiple length scales. In recent manuscripts, a reader might find peculiar-looking soft robots capable of grasping, walking, or swimming. However, the growth in publication numbers does not always reflect the real progress in the field since many manuscripts employ very similar ideas and just tweak soft body geometries. Therefore, we unreservedly agree with the sentiment that future research must move beyond ``soft for soft's sake.'' Soft robotics is an undoubtedly fascinating field, but it requires a critical assessment of the limitations and challenges, enabling us to spotlight the areas and directions where soft robots will have the best leverage over their traditional counterparts. In this perspective paper, we discuss the current state of robotic research related to such important aspects as energy autonomy, electronic-free logic, and sustainability. The goal is to critically look at perspectives of soft robotics from two opposite points of view provided by early career researchers and highlight the most promising future direction, that is, in our opinion, the employment of soft robotic technologies for soft bio-inspired artificial organs.},

The transference of the functions and underlying structural principles of plants thus enables the development of novel life-like technical materials systems. For example, principles involved in the hinge-less movements of carnivorous snap-trap plants and climbing plants can be used in technical applications. A combination of the snap-trap motion of two plant species (Aldrovanda vesiculosa and Dionaea muscipula) has led to the creation of a novel motion sequence for plant-inspired robotics in an artificial Venus flytrap system, the Venus Flyflap. The novel motion pattern of Venus Flyflap lobes has been characterized by using four state-of-the-art actuation systems. A kinematic analysis of the individual phases of the new motion cycle has been performed by utilizing precise pneumatic actuation. Contactless magnetic actuation augments lobe motion into energy-efficient resonance-like oscillatory motion. The use of environmentally driven actuator materials has allowed autonomous motion generation via changes in environmental conditions. Measurement of the energy required for the differently actuated movements has shown that the Venus Flyflap is not only faster than the biological models in its closing movement, but also requires less energy in certain cases for the execution of this movement.},

  abstract = {Robots are becoming more and important and can support humans in all possible areas of life. Due to their inherent compliance, soft robots are ideal for human-machine interaction. In contrast to their material compliance, soft robots such as walkers are often still powered and controlled by rigid and bulky electronics. In this study, we show a walking compliant robot, which is 3D printed by FDM printers, controlled by soft, pneumatic logic gates, and powered only by a source of constant pressurized air. The robots form and gait are inspired by the stick insect (Carausius morosus). To mimic the walking gait in fast walking on horizontal planes and the interdependency of the legs, we developed bioinspired pneumatic actuators functioning as legs and implemented a novel pneumatic logic circuit. In this circuit, one pair of legs can only transition from stance to swing when the other pair of legs has touched the ground. Our results demonstrate how the field of soft robotics can advance with critical technology such as soft, pneumatic logic gates being printed on FDM printers. We envision that our system will continue to evolve with the incorporation of even more advanced control circuits, enabling the robot to operate at even higher speed. The lifting capacity has the potential to be further optimized and an on-board pressure supply system can be implemented, allowing for more efficient and effective performance. This will ultimately lead to a fully autonomous soft machine.},

  abstract = {Small-world networks, according to Watts and Strogatz, are a class of networks that are ``highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs.'' These characteristics result in networks with unique properties of regional specialization with efficient information transfer. Social networks are intuitive examples of this organization, in which cliques or clusters of friends being interconnected but each person is really only five or six people away from anyone else. Although this qualitative definition has prevailed in network science theory, in application, the standard quantitative application is to compare path length (a surrogate measure of distributed processing) and clustering (a surrogate measure of regional specialization) to an equivalent random network. It is demonstrated here that comparing network clustering to that of a random network can result in aberrant findings and that networks once thought to exhibit small-world properties may not. We propose a new small-world metric, {$\omega$} (omega), which compares network clustering to an equivalent lattice network and path length to a random network, as Watts and Strogatz originally described. Example networks are presented that would be interpreted as small-world when clustering is compared to a random network but are not small-world according to {$\omega$}. These findings have important implications in network science because small-world networks have unique topological properties, and it is critical to accurately distinguish them from networks without simultaneous high clustering and short path length.},

This paper presents an extensive experimental study to systematically examine and compare the quality of opinions created by these two research techniques. Depending on experimental condition, participants either participated in a focus group meeting or completed an ICQ. In both conditions participants received identical factual information about two specific CCS options. After having processed the information, they indicated their overall opinion about each CCS option. The quality of these opinions was determined by looking at three outcome-oriented indicators of opinion quality: consistency, stability, and confidence. Results for all three indicators showed that ICQs yielded higher-quality opinions than focus groups, but also that focus groups did not perform poor in this regard. Implications for the choice between focus group discussions and ICQs are discussed.},

He presents a series of studies that describe the psychological and neural processes that have led to breakthroughs in science, medicine, and technology. He shows how discoveries of new theories and explanations lead to conceptual change, with examples from biology, psychology, and medicine. Finally, he shows how the cognitive science of science can integrate descriptive and normative concerns; and he considers the neural underpinnings of certain scientific concepts.},

Paul Thagard proposes a general theory of coherence as the satisfaction of multiple interacting constraints, and discusses the theory's numerous psychological and philosophical applications. Much of human cognition can be understood in terms of coherence as constraint satisfaction, and many of the central problems of philosophy can be given coherence-based solutions. Thagard shows how coherence can help to unify psychology and philosophy, particularly when addressing questions of epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and aesthetics.

Emotions can have good effects, as when a scientist gets excited about a line of research and pursues it successfully despite criticism. But emotions can also distort reasoning, as when a juror ignores evidence of guilt just because the accused seems like a nice guy. In Hot Thought, Paul Thagard describes the mental mechanisms--cognitive, neural, molecular, and social--that interact to produce different kinds of human thinking, from everyday decision making to legal reasoning, scientific discovery, and religious belief, and he discusses when and how thinking and reasoning should be emotional. Thagard argues that an understanding of emotional thinking needs to integrate the cognitive, neural, molecular, and social levels. Many of the chapters employ computational models of various levels of thinking, including HOTCO (hot cognition) models and the more neurologically realistic GAGE model. Thagard uses these models to illuminate thinking in the domains of law, science, and religion, discussing such topics as the role of doubt and reasonable doubt in legal and other contexts, valuable emotional habits for successful scientists, and the emotional content of religious beliefs. Identifying and assessing the impact of emotion, Thagard argues, can suggest ways to improve the process of reasoning.},

The chapters, by leading scholars in both the cognitive and the social sciences, explore the relationship between cognition and society, including such issues as methodologies of studying cultural differences; the psychological basis of politics (for instance, the role of emotion and the psychology of moral choices); cognitive dimensions of religion; cognitive approaches to economics; meta-theoretical questions on the possibility of the unification of social and cognitive sciences. Combining depth and breadth, the book encourages fruitful interdisciplinary interaction across many fields.},

  abstract = {Cognitive science approaches the study of mind and intelligence from an interdisciplinary perspective, working at the intersection of philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, linguistics, and anthropology. With Mind, Paul Thagard offers an introduction to this interdisciplinary field for readers who come to the subject with very different backgrounds. It is suitable for classroom use by students with interests ranging from computer science and engineering to psychology and philosophy.Thagard's systematic descriptions and evaluations of the main theories of mental representation advanced by cognitive scientists allow students to see that there are many complementary approaches to the investigation of mind. The fundamental theoretical perspectives he describes include logic, rules, concepts, analogies, images, and connections (artificial neural networks). The discussion of these theories provides an integrated view of the different achievements of the various fields of cognitive science.This second edition includes substantial revision and new material. Part I, which presents the different theoretical approaches, has been updated in light of recent work the field. Part II, which treats extensions to cognitive science, has been thoroughly revised, with new chapters added on brains, emotions, and consciousness. Other additions include a list of relevant Web sites at the end of each chapter and a glossary at the end of the book. As in the first edition, each chapter concludes with a summary and suggestions for further reading.},

It draws on the burgeoning field of affective neuroscience, which is the study of the neurobiology of emotional systems in the brain. I show that a recent neurocomputational model of how the brain integrates cognitive and affective information in decision-making can help to answer some important descriptive and normative questions about the moral psychology of conflicts of interest. These questions include: Why are decisions that involve conflicts of interest so common? Why are people so often unaware that they are acting immorally as the result of conflicts of interest? What is the relation of conflicts of interest to other kinds of irrationality, especially self-deception and weakness of will? What psychological, social, and logical steps can be taken to reduce the occurrence of immoral decisions resulting from conflicts of interest? I discuss five strategies for dealing with conflicts of interest: avoidance, optimal reasoning patterns, disclosure, social oversight, and understanding of neuropsychological processes.},

Answers to such questions can benefit from cognitive science\textemdash the interdisciplinary field that includes neuroscience and computer modeling as well as psychology. According to principles of emotional coherence, attitudes develop and change because of connections among the values attached to systems of concepts, beliefs, and goals. People attach a positive value to concepts such as equality, if the concept fits with other positive concepts such as human needs, and opposes negative concepts such as poverty. Emotional coherence balances positive and negative values to yield an overall conclusion. Computer models based on emotional coherence explain people's differing attitudes about equality and issues such as transgender rights. They also model how people sometimes change their minds.},

Normative questions include whether human thinking should be Bayesian, whether decision making should maximize expected utility, and how norms should be established.

  abstract = {Chunking is the recoding of smaller units of information into larger, familiar units. Chunking is often assumed to help bypassing the limited capacity of working memory (WM). We investigate how chunks are used in WM tasks, addressing three questions: (a) Does chunking reduce the load on WM? Across four experiments chunking benefits were found not only for recall of the chunked but also of other not-chunked information concurrently held in WM, supporting the assumption that chunking reduces load. (b) Is the chunking benefit independent of chunk size? The chunking benefit was independent of chunk size only if the chunks were composed of unique elements, so that each chunk could be replaced by its first element (Experiment 1), but not when several chunks consisted of overlapping sets of elements, disabling this replacement strategy (Experiments 2 and 3). The chunk-size effect is not due to differences in rehearsal duration as it persisted when participants were required to perform articulatory suppression (Experiment 3). Hence, WM capacity is not limited to a fixed number of chunks regardless of their size. (c) Does the chunking benefit depend on the serial position of the chunk? Chunks in early list positions improved recall of other, not-chunked material, but chunks at the end of the list did not. We conclude that a chunk reduces the load on WM via retrieval of a compact chunk representation from long-term memory that replaces the representations of individual elements of the chunk. This frees up capacity for subsequently encoded material. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

This increased consideration largely rests on the question of whether disgust can and should play a role\textemdash even a decisive role\textemdash in moral judgment. Some ethicists believe that disgust manifests the emotional expression of a ``deep wisdom,'' and in this respect may constitute the last bulwark against eroding social norms associated with technological development.

This essay investigates the precarious status of disgust in the Anthropocene, a global age of artifice and engineering that increasingly challenges the ``natural order'' of things.

Over the past decades, two such models have become most widely used: the Five Factor Model (FFM) or Big Five, respectively, and the HEXACO Model of Personality. However, there is no large-scale empirical evidence on the general comparability of these models. Here, we provide the first comprehensive meta-analysis on (a) the correspondence of the FFM/Big Five and HEXACO dimensions, (b) the scope of trait content the models cover, and (c) the orthogonality (i.e., degree of independence) of dimensions within the models. Results based on 152 (published and unpublished) samples and 6,828 unique effects showed that the HEXACO dimensions incorporate notable conceptual differences compared to the FFM/Big Five dimensions, resulting in a broader coverage of the personality space and less redundancy between dimensions. Moreover, moderator analyses revealed substantial differences between operationalizations of the FFM/Big Five. Taken together, these findings have important theoretical and practical implications for the understanding of basic personality dimensions and their assessment.},

In so doing we adopt a broad, psycho-socially inspired conception of perceived naturalness in order to explore how perceptions of CCS in biomass, fossil fuel, and industrial applications are formed in the context of a range of potential technologies for supporting low carbon energy system transitions. In particular, we explore how perceptions of naturalness and interdependency shaped perceptions of different CCS applications. Our analysis illustrates how perceptions of CCS as threatening, uncanny disruptions to natural systems may shift when re-contextualised to include concerns relating to the intermittency of renewable energy, or be ameliorated through perceptions of industrial and bioenergy applications as supporting natural and economic interdependencies.},

Responses were elicited from a convenience sample of students (5th, 8th and 11th grade, and college level) and senior citizens (n = 238). All subjects constructed a concept map on sharks and responded to a Likert-type attitude inventory. Based on the work of Novak and Gowin ( Leaning How to Learn, Cambridge University Press, 1984), concept maps were scored for frequencies of non-redundant concepts and scientifically valid relationships, levels of hierarchy, incidence of branching and number of crosslinks. The attitude inventory, emerging from Kellert's ( The Value of Life: Biological Diversity and Human Society, Island Press, 1996) work, generated subscale scores on four affective dimensions: scientific, naturalistic, moralistic and utilitarian/negative. Significant differences were found among subject groups on all knowledge structure variables and attitudinal dimensions. Gender differences were documented on three of four attitude subscales. A series of simple, mulitiple and canonical correlations revealed moderately strong relationships between knowledge structure variables and attitudinal dimensions. The pattern of these relationships supports conservation education efforts and instructional practices that encourage meaningful learning, knowledge restructuring and conceptual change (Mintzes et al., Assessing Science Understanding: A Human Constructivist View, Academic Press, 2000).},

To develop an extensive knowledge scale, we therefore examined the Swiss public's understanding of climate change in a mail survey and related this scale to attitudes toward climate change. We thereby aimed to consider a broad range of climate-related knowledge, namely physical knowledge about CO2 and the greenhouse effect, knowledge about climate change and its causes, knowledge about the expected consequences of climate change, and action-related knowledge. The questionnaire included items of different degrees of difficulty, ranging from knowledge that is covered by newspapers to experts' knowledge. Our findings indicate that people still hold several misconceptions, although people's knowledge related to CO2 seems to have increased compared to previous studies. Of all knowledge subscales, knowledge about climate change and causes was most strongly related to attitudes toward climate change.},

Drawing on both classic and modern research from cognitive psychology, social psychology, and survey methodology, the authors examine how survey responses are formulated and they demonstrate how seemingly unimportant features of the survey can affect the answers obtained. The book provides a comprehensive review of the sources of response errors in surveys, and it offers a coherent theory of the relation between the underlying views of the public and the results of public opinion polls. Topics include the comprehension of survey questions, the recall of relevant facts and beliefs, estimation and inferential processes people use to answer survey questions, the sources of the apparent instability of public opinion, the difficulties in getting responses into the required format, and the distortions introduced into surveys by deliberate misreporting.},

An increasing number of studies have been carried out over the years contributing to the development of TA literature. Some of these studies summarized the history and growth of the field during its evolution. However, there has been no effort made to present an overview of the methods and tools that have been cited in TA literature. This paper attempts to fill that void. A thorough review of the TA articles published in leading journals in the management of technology field is conducted to identify the research methods or tools in those studies. The paper provides an introductory review of the use of technology assessment terminology during its development, which helps the readers avoid the confusion of the TA concept since its origination in public decision making forty years ago and where it is now \textemdash{} widely adopted in other sectors. A thorough presentation of the approaches, methods and tools that have been introduced or employed in both mainstream TA and ``inverted TA'' studies is then provided.

Our study showed that the explicit guidance in comparing the two concept maps was more effective than the non-explicit, eliciting a variety of different, more specific, types of interactions and patterns (e.g. `hierarchy', `dynamism', `homeostasis') in the students' descriptions of the human body system. The reflection interview as a knowledge integration activity was found to be an effective tool for assessing the subjects' conceptual models of `system complexity', and for identifying those aspects of a system that are most commonly misunderstood.},

In this paper, using Monte Carlo simulation, the performance of these reliability coefficients under a one-dimensional model is evaluated in terms of skewness and no tau-equivalence. The results show that omega coefficient is always better choice than alpha and in the presence of skew items is preferable to use omega and glb coefficients even in small samples.},

  abstract = {The European Commission advocates for the implementation of more sustainable food systems. To accelerate the transition towards zero waste for the benefit of citizens, industry, public organizations, and to preserve biodiversity, it is necessary to re-design our relationship with the planet's resources. The European Commission proposal on the circular economy (2015) has set high targets in relation to reusing, upcycling, and recycling of plastic materials. In this context, it is imperative to re-evaluate how we protect foods with packaging. In this work, we report the results of one-on-one interviews with policy makers, citizens, and industry actors held over the spring/summer period of 2021 across European countries. The interviews (2 per group, 6 per country, for a total of 54 interviews) highlighted the need to advance and improve policies, thereby leading to better industrial and societal practices in the EU. Furthermore, harmonization of policies and practices is needed to achieve the set sustainability targets. Key regional differences across Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Norway, Estonia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany became apparent during the interviews, especially in relation to the infrastructure for collecting, sorting and using of packaging waste. The interviews also showed that policymakers and industrial stakeholders have common goals towards a more circular economy. However, such collaborations require a whole systems approach to achieve behavioral changes towards this goal. Using ideation tools, namely the Iceberg model and the Berkana two-loop model, the different food packaging challenges were identified, explored and evaluated in terms of their feasibility and impact on sustainability. Furthermore, the main solutions were categorized in an Impact-effort matrix. These tools, through an extensive analysis, demonstrated that the integration of sustainable food packaging solutions within Europe depends more on policies and stakeholders' mindsets than on technical aspects.},

This second-order complexity invites consideration of the modes of thinking we use to theorize about complexity, and in this article we develop the idea of second-order complexity using Jerome Bruner's contrast between logico-scientific and narrative modes of thinking. Using Bruner's framework, we examine and critique dominant forms of thinking about organizational complexity that are rooted in the logico-scientific mode, and suggest alternatives based in the narrative mode. Our evidence for the value of doing this comes from the logic of complexity theory itself, which we claim indicates and supports the use of the narrative mode. The potential contribution of the narrative approach to developing second-order thinking about organizational complexity is demonstrated by taking a narrative approach to the matter of recursiveness. By extension, similar insights are indicated for other features that logico-scientific thinkers commonly attribute to complex systems, including, nonlinearity, indeterminacy, unpredictability and emergence.},

Method We performed a systematic literature review based on a search of six digital libraries, along with vote-counting meta-analysis to analyse the overall results. Results The search identified 79 relevant empirical studies in 73 articles. The results show that BI is likely to be correlated with actual usage. However, the TAM variables perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU) are less likely to be correlated with actual usage. Conclusion Care should be taken using the TAM outside the context in which it has been validated.},

Each case of qualitative research is a singular process, requiring the researcher to craft his or her own method or make changes in accordance with the circumstances. As a result, the study's process and decisions taken along the way often remain obscure to the reader. The purpose of the current paper is to discuss the importance of transparency in qualitative research, arguing that it is a critical component of what creates best practice. Furthermore, in order for qualitative inquiry to thrive within the field of psychology today, there is a need for both greater systematization of the research process and better dissemination of the information yielded. It could even be suggested that readers derive a greater benefit from seeing what has gone on ``behind closed doors'' than from learning the study's results. After reviewing the literature, a model for improving transparency is suggested. The model suggests that researchers should consider three central reflexive questions regarding each stage of the research: what I did, how I did it, and why I did it. Each question is discussed, and a practical guide for improving transparency is suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events.

We evaluate the pros and cons of these alternatives and conclude that the ISP does have several advantages over these other methods, especially for psychological research. All of these sequential methods can save research resources because smaller sample sizes are required compared to standard nonsequential methods, so it seems appropriate for researchers to choose from a variety of sequential methods based on the practical requirements of their research.

The properties of p-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of these simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be used as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a certain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually demonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous mathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined without simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any statistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough evaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions p-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition, we used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of publication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence the shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than 1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also suggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an article as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level. This gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of real effects even when no such effects are actually present. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This paper argues that although moral intuitions are insufficient for making judgments on new technological innovations, they maintain great utility for informing responsible innovation. To do this, this paper employs the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) methodology as an illustrative example of how stakeholder values can be better distilled to inform responsible innovation. Further, it is argued that moral intuitions are necessary for determining stakeholder values required for the design of responsible technologies. This argument is supported by the claim that the moral intuitions of stakeholders allow designers to conceptualize stakeholder values and incorporate them into the early phases of design. It is concluded that design-for-values (DFV) frameworks like the VSD methodology can remain potent if developers adopt heuristic tools to diminish the influence of cognitive biases thus strengthening the reliability of moral intuitions.},

The literature is large and spans multiple contexts, methods, theoretical and disciplinary perspectives and paradigms. While this diversity is in many ways healthy, experience suggests that it can be confusing for those without close knowledge of its constituent parts. Here we set out a framework for thinking about energy technology `acceptance' that is relatively neutral in normative and theoretical terms, while acknowledging that a full integration of perspectives and complete theoretical neutrality are not possible. We do not claim a comprehensive review base, but draw on our experience to illustrate the diversity of what we regard as the more influential perspectives in the literature.},

The question is, can we validly measure people's commitment by what they say and what they claim they do in opinion polls? In our research, we demonstrate that opinions and reports of past behavior can be aggregated into comparable depictions of people's personal commitment to fighting climate change and protecting the environment (i.e., their environmental attitudes). In contrast to the commonly used operational scaling approaches, we ground our measure of people's environmental attitudes in a mathematically formalized psychological theory of the response process\textemdash the Campbell paradigm. This theory of the response process has already been extensively validated, and its relevance for manifest behavior has repeatedly been shown as well. In our secondary analysis of Eurobarometer data (N = 27,998) from 28 European countries, we apply the Campbell paradigm to a set of indicators that was not originally collected to be aggregated into a single scale. With our research, we propose a distinct way to measure behavior-relevant environmental attitudes that can be used even with a set of indicators that was originally atheoretically compiled. Overall, our study suggests that the Campbell paradigm provides a sound psychological measurement theory that can be applied to cross-cultural comparisons in the environmental protection domain.},

Among the common aspects of these normative frameworks and proposals is the reliance on foresight and/or anticipation as a key interventive dimension or instrument. The article reviews the main challenges to which anticipation has been explicitly or implicitly directed and the respective methodological approaches that have been associated with them. In doing so, the article diagnoses a fragmentation in the methodological treatment of the different challenges. Against this fragmentation, a multi-foresight methodology is proposed. The proposed methodology not only addresses the fragmentation problem by embracing the different challenges posed to foresight/anticipation for promoting more socio-politically responsible technoscientific and innovation practices, but also aims to minimise the uncritical reification of futures.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth in the number of identified interactions between biological molecules. These interactions are usually represented as large and complex networks, calling for the development of appropriated tools to exploit the functional information they contain. Random walk with restart (RWR) is the state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach. It explores the network vicinity of gene/protein seeds to study their functions, based on the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend to lie close to each other in the networks.In this study, we extended the RWR algorithm to multiplex and heterogeneous networks. The walk can now explore different layers of physical and functional interactions between genes and proteins, such as protein\textendash protein interactions and co-expression associations. In addition, the walk can also jump to a network containing different sets of edges and nodes, such as phenotype similarities between diseases. We devised a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to evaluate the algorithms abilities to predict disease-associated genes. We demonstrate the increased performances of the multiplex-heterogeneous RWR as compared to several random walks on monoplex or heterogeneous networks. Overall, our framework is able to leverage the different interaction sources to outperform current approaches. Finally, we applied the algorithm to predict candidate genes for the Wiedemann\textendash Rautenstrauch syndrome, and to explore the network vicinity of the SHORT syndrome.The source code is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/RWR-MH.

To address this historical gap, a notable stream of research on emotions in innovation adoption has emerged in recent years. To enrich our understanding of the psychology of innovation adoption, this paper integrates insights from research on emotions in psychology with a systematic review of the literature on consumer emotions in innovation adoption. Drawing on well-established theories of emotions and decision-making, we derive five fundamental dimensions that help define the role of emotions in the consumer adoption of innovations. A systematic review of existing evidence within the specific field of innovation adoption summarises the existing evidence through the lens of the five dimensions. The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, the paper offers a novel perspective that provides a deeper understanding of emotions as a psychological mechanism enabling or impeding innovation adoption. Second, we set an agenda for invigorating research in this important domain.},

IA practitioners realise that. However: \textendash{} Not all uncertainties can be adequately addressed with existingmethods and tools. This especially holds for uncertainty in model structure and uncertainty due to behavioural and societal variability, value diversity, technological surprise, ignorance and indeterminacy. \textendash{} Uncertainty is usually treated as a marginal issue, as an additional physical variable, as a mathematical artifact. The current methods merely involve evaluation of the impacts of `certain uncertainties', i.e. uncertainties for which estimates or probability distributions are available.\textendash{} Current methods give no indication of the magnitude and sources of thevarious underlying uncertainties and the aggregated uncertainty measures are difficult to understand to decision-makers and other audiences.Within the International Centre for Integrative Studies, Maastricht University (the Netherlands), the research project `Perspectives on uncertainty and risk' aims to develop alternative, complementary approaches to uncertainty management in Integrated Assessment. The current paper summarises the theoretical analysis of the concept of uncertainty, and it proposes a typology of sources of uncertainty. This paper further discusses insights and experiences with pluralistic uncertainty management in thecontext of Integrated Assessment modelling in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach. Although systematic fundamental uncertainty research is still needed in the context of Integrated Assessment, this paper argues that significant profit in quality terms can be gained by using the available methods, including the pluralistic approach, more consciously and systematically.},

Based on literature analysis, quantitative document analysis and semi-structured interviews, we describe the historic evolution of the interactions between IAMs and policy-making between 1970 and 2015. We identify five historic phases in which IAMs played distinct mediating roles between science and policy, succeeding to adjust their scenario efforts to the continuously changing demands for knowledge from the policy community. In explaining the prominent role of IAMs, we differentiate between background conditions (material and sociological) and more contextual factors, most notably the flexible, hybrid and broad nature of IAMs as well as the pro-active character of the IAM community to enhance their policy relevance. We draw on the notion of institutional work to explain this success. In light of the urgency of responding to the climate crisis, we suggest that the IAM community may expand their scope of anticipated futures and consider engaging a wider range of publics and societal stakeholders beyond the science-policy interface.},

Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have recently moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. However, the statistical tools to do so are lacking. In this article, we present the network comparison test (NCT), which uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of (a) network structure, (b) edge (connection) strength, and (c) global strength. Performance of NCT is evaluated in simulations that show NCT to perform well in various circumstances for all three tests: The Type I error rate is close to the nominal significance level, and power proves sufficiently high if sample size and difference between networks are substantial. We illustrate NCT by comparing depression symptom networks of males and females. Possible extensions of NCT are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Given the importance of mental models, a new tool to assess mental models has been developed: the Mental Model Mapping Tool (M-Tool). M-Tool was designed to have a standardized format and to be user-friendly for low literacy populations, using pictograms and audio instructions. In this paper, we evaluate M-Tool's application in two studies with Tanzanian fishers. In Study 1, we investigated M-tool's convergent validity compared to standard interviewing methods (n =\,30). Study 2 investigated M-Tool's construct validity by relating mental model complexity to participants' education level (n =\,185), a relationship that has been well established. The findings show that (1) mental models produced with M-Tool are more complex than mental models obtained through interviewing techniques; (2) model composition is similar across the two methods; and (3) participants with higher levels of education tend to produce more complex mental models with M-Tool than participants with lower levels of education, in line with previous research. These findings suggest that M-Tool can successfully capture mental models among diverse participants. This tool offers researchers and practitioners an instrument to map and compare perceptions of (conservation) challenges across groups.},

  abstract = {Stakeholder mental model elicitation can produce valuable insights into perceptions of complex systems such as ecosystems, economies, or the climate. These mental models can uncover crucial differences in perceptions between stakeholders and prevalent misunderstandings of the system, which can ultimately contribute to successful resource management. This paper introduces a novel tool to capture mental models: M-Tool. M-Tool was designed to be user-friendly for diverse samples, and standardized to ease aggregation and comparison of mental models. With this tool, participants create influence diagrams with a fixed set of pictograms representing the system variables, and weighted arrows to display their relations. M-Tool can be used to identify differences or changes in mental models or to co-produce knowledge with stakeholders and develop strategies to address challenges within the system. This paper describes how to tailor the tool to a research project and discusses how M-Tool may be suitable for diverse research applications. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

Gender, political party, knowledge of the causes, impacts and responses to climate change, social norms, value orientations, affect and personal experience with extreme weather were all identified as significant predictors. Experiential and socio-cultural factors explained significantly more variance in risk perception than either cognitive or socio-demographic characteristics. Results also confirm that the factor analytic structure of climate change risk perceptions can be conceptualized along two key dimensions, namely: personal and societal risk judgments and that both dimensions have different psychological antecedents.

The dependent variable was the intention to use one of three modes for work travel after getting a job: car, public transit, or other modes. The explanatory variables were three attitude factors taken from a previous study, including: 1/symbolic affective, reflecting affective motives of travel mode use; 2/instrumental, referring to functional attributes of travel modes; and 3/social orderliness which represents for environmental friendliness, safety, altruism, quietness et cetera. Several logit model estimates were made using the samples from the six countries separately and together. We obtained three main findings. First, attitude variables about the car were all significant determinants for the entire sample from Asian countries. Second, the social orderliness aspect of public transit was a common concern of respondents from developing countries in selecting this mode for work trips. Third, in countries in which the intent to use a car was not very high, attitude factors about the car were found to be significant determinants of the behavioral intention to commute by car but were less significant in countries in which the desire to use a car was high.},

To achieve this, a basic distinction is made between TA directed toward the promotion side of technology (Constructive Technology Assessment [CTA]) and the control side (Parliamentary TA). In particular, CTA can be seen as a major source of the idea of framing innovation policy in terms of transformative innovation and RI. Originally, the practice of CTA was directed toward democratizing the promotion side of technology. The practice of RI has the broader ambition of encompassing both the promotion and the control side of technology. Parliamentary TA's familiarity with the control side of technology could inspire RI. At the same time, RI challenges Parliamentary TA to pay more attention to the promotion side of technology and to stimulating politically desired effects of innovation. Accordingly, the paper describes three challenges faced by both TA and RI: representation, issue identification, and directionality. Since Parliamentary TA and RI can inspire each other in many ways, a more intensive interaction between CTA/RI practitioners and Parliamentary/RI practitioners is both desirable and necessary.},

In this study, we examine how these properties relate to a word's connectivity in the mental lexicon, the structure containing a person's knowledge of words. In particular, we examine the extent to which these properties display assortative mixing, that is, the extent to which words in the lexicon are more likely to be connected to words that share these properties. We investigated three types of word properties: 1) subjective word covariates: valence, dominance, arousal, and concreteness; 2) lexical information: part of speech; and 3) distributional word properties: age-of-acquisition, word frequency, and contextual diversity. We assessed which of these factors exhibit assortativity using a word association task, where the probability of producing a certain response to a cue is a measure of the associative strength between the cue and response in the mental lexicon. Our results show that the extent to which these aspects exhibit assortativity varies considerably, with a high cue-response correspondence on valence, dominance, arousal, concreteness, and part of speech, indicating that these factors correspond to the words people deem as related. In contrast, we find that cues and responses show only little correspondence on word frequency, contextual diversity, and age-of-acquisition, indicating that, compared to subjective and lexical word covariates, distributional properties exhibit only little assortativity in the mental lexicon. Possible theoretical accounts and implications of these findings are discussed.},

Many reviews and meta-analyses have been published examining the effectiveness of interventions to promote pro-environmental behaviour. Yet, it remains unclear which interventions are most effective, when and why. Because interventions are more likely to encourage pro-environmental behaviour when they target key determinants of the relevant behaviour, it is critical to understand which interventions target which determinants. We introduce a classification system that links six types of interventions to 13 determinants of environmental behaviour. Our classification enables a theory-based understanding of when and why interventions are effective (or not) in encouraging pro-environmental behaviour and provides guidelines to practitioners to select interventions that are most likely to change the key determinants of a specific target behaviour, and thus likely to be the most successful in changing behaviour in the given context.},

Given the centrality of reciprocity as a component for our moral lives (for moral development and maintaining the just society), this paper confronts the possibility of what things would look like if the benchmark to achieve perceived reciprocity were accomplished. Through an analysis of the value of reciprocity from the care ethics tradition the richness of reciprocity as an inherent value is revealed: on the micro-level, as mutual care for immediate care givers, and on the macro-level, as foundational for a just society. Taking this understanding of reciprocity into consideration, it becomes clear that HRI cannot achieve this bidirectional value of reciprocity; a robot must deceive users into believing it is capable of reciprocating to humans or is deserving of reciprocation from humans. Moreover, on the macro-level, designing social robots for reciprocity threatens the ability and willingness to reciprocate to human care workers across society. Because of these concerns, I suggest re-thinking the goals of reciprocity in social robotics. Designing for reciprocity in social robotics should be dedicated to the design of robots to enhance the ability to mutually care for those that provide us with care, as opposed to designing for reciprocity between human and robot.},

From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations.},

  abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

  abstract = {To determine the content of integrated curricula, clinical concepts and the underlying basic science concepts need to be made explicit. Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula.},

However, because the potential ecological and political side effects of SRM are not well understood, and because SRM will cross national boundaries, an international research perspective on the general public's perception of this technology is required. We conducted an online survey on the general public's perception and acceptance of SRM in Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Our findings confirmed the need for an international perspective, as we found several cross-country differences. Chinese respondents, for example, indicated greater acceptance for SRM than their North American and European counterparts. Moreover, results of regression analyses on acceptance of SRM by country revealed that lower acceptability ratings for SRM in Canada and Europe were mostly related to stronger beliefs that SRM tampers with nature. Chinese respondents, by contrast, were more accepting of SRM when they held stronger beliefs that it may reduce the motivation to adopt burdensome climate change mitigation efforts. Although our research\textemdash and previous studies\textemdash suggest that opposition to SRM remains, dismissing the technology entirely on these grounds and without conducting a careful, cross-national, and transdisciplinary decision-support process to set up an international policy regime seems premature as people from countries that are less prepared to mitigate and adapt to climate change seem to be more supportive of SRM.},

Although country-level factors such as economic development, government effectiveness and innovation do not directly influence public acceptance of AI/Robot, they do have significant effects on Perceived threat of general job loss due to AI/Robot, and Digital technology efficacy. Findings indicate that these nationally macro variables influence people's perceptions of AI and robotics technologies and their confidence in their digital skills. This research enriches the application of the Technology Acceptance Model by using predictive variables at two levels: individual and country. Furthermore, at the individual level, this study uses two variables (e.g. Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy) that are unconventional to TAM, thus contributing to this theoretical model.},

It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result\textemdash a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label ``confirmatory,'' and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled ``exploratory.'' We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception.},

This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage\textendash Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility.},

It focuses on the uncertainty perceived from the point of view of those providing information to support policy decisions (i.e., the modellers' view on uncertainty) \textendash{} uncertainty regarding the analytical outcomes and conclusions of the decision support exercise. Within the regulatory and management sciences, there is neither commonly shared terminology nor full agreement on a typology of uncertainties. Our aim is to synthesise a wide variety of contributions on uncertainty in model-based decision support in order to provide an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for systematic uncertainty analysis. To that end we adopt a general definition of uncertainty as being any deviation from the unachievable ideal of completely deterministic knowledge of the relevant system. We further propose to discriminate among three dimensions of uncertainty: location, level and nature of uncertainty, and we harmonise existing typologies to further detail the concepts behind these three dimensions of uncertainty. We propose an uncertainty matrix as a heuristic tool to classify and report the various dimensions of uncertainty, thereby providing a conceptual framework for better communication among analysts as well as between them and policymakers and stakeholders. Understanding the various dimensions of uncertainty helps in identifying, articulating, and prioritising critical uncertainties, which is a crucial step to more adequate acknowledgement and treatment of uncertainty in decision support endeavours and more focused research on complex, inherently uncertain, policy issues.},

This Canada-wide study surveyed 1014 consumers and their willingness to pay premiums for sustainable food packaging alternatives and motivations to reduce single-use plastic waste. Overwhelmingly, most (93.7\%) respondents were personally motivated to reduce consumption of single-use plastic food packaging. Canadians were highly motivated to reduce single-use plastic food packaging, but less willing to pay for sustainable alternatives. While environmental concerns were more critical than food safety, Canadians acknowledged that sustainable packaging alternatives were more desirable than outright plastic bag bans, despite not willing to pay for them. Using approaches that consider multiple driving factors on consumer behavior and opinions towards use of single-use plastic food packaging, limitations, recommendations and future research are proposed.},

By comparing different levels of complex behavior in biological systems, this Viewpoint strives to give some definition of the various different materials systems characteristics.

This Viewpoint aims to also serve as a switchboard to further connect the important fields of systems chemistry, synthetic biology, supramolecular chemistry and nano- and microfabrication/3D printing with advanced soft materials research. A convergence of these disciplines will be at the heart of empowering future adaptive and interactive materials systems with increasingly complex and emergent life-like behavior.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews are comprehensive reviews of the literature for a highly focused research question. These reviews are often treated as the highest form of evidence in evidence-based medicine, and are the key strategy to answer research questions in the medical field. To create a high-quality systematic review, complex Boolean queries are often constructed to retrieve studies for the review topic. However, it often takes a long time for systematic review researchers to construct a high quality systematic review Boolean query, and often the resulting queries are far from effective. Poor queries may lead to biased or invalid reviews, because they missed to retrieve key evidence, or to extensive increase in review costs, because they retrieved too many irrelevant studies. Recent advances in Transformer-based generative models have shown great potential to effectively follow instructions from users and generate answers based on the instructions being made. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the latest of such models, ChatGPT, in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. Through a number of extensive experiments on standard test collections for the task, we find that ChatGPT is capable of generating queries that lead to high search precision, although trading-off this for recall. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of ChatGPT in generating effective Boolean queries for systematic review literature search. The ability of ChatGPT to follow complex instructions and generate queries with high precision makes it a valuable tool for researchers conducting systematic reviews, particularly for rapid reviews where time is a constraint and often trading-off higher precision for lower recall is acceptable.},

  abstract = {Soft robots have recently attracted increased attention because their characteristics of low-cost fabrication, durability, and deformability make them uniquely suited for applications in bio-integrated systems. Being fundamentally different from traditional rigid robots, soft robots exhibit properties of infinite degrees of freedom (DOF) and nonlinear materials properties that require innovations in control systems. With the rapid development of materials science, robotics, and artificial intelligence, the diversification of actuator mechanisms and algorithms has enabled a wide range of unique control strategies. This review summarizes the basics of actuator mechanisms and control strategies, including open-loop control, closed-loop control, and autonomous control, and discusses their implementation from diversified perspectives. Control strategies are evaluated based on their compatibility with materials sets, application goals, and implementation route. The emerging directions are forecasted from the perspectives of interfacing between controller and actuator, underactuated control strategies, and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI).},

With the extensive use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other forms of land-use change, anthropogenic activities have contributed to the ever-increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, causing global climate change. In response to the worsening global climate change, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is the most pressing task on the planet. To this end, it is of utmost importance and a significant challenge to reform the current production systems to reduce GHG emissions and promote the capture of CO2 from the atmosphere. Herein, we review innovative technologies that offer solutions achieving carbon (C) neutrality and sustainable development, including those for renewable energy production, food system transformation, waste valorization, C sink conservation, and C-negative manufacturing. The wealth of knowledge disseminated in this review could inspire the global community and drive the further development of innovative technologies to mitigate climate change and sustainably support human activities.},

  abstract = {Content analysis is a common and flexible technique to quantify and make sense of qualitative data in psychological research. However, the practical implementation of content analysis is extremely labor-intensive and subject to human coder errors. Applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques can help address these limitations. We explain and illustrate these techniques to psychological researchers. For this purpose, we first present a study exploring the creation of psychometrically meaningful predictions of human content codes. Using an existing database of human content codes, we build an NLP algorithm to validly predict those codes, at generally acceptable standards. We then conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation to model how four dataset characteristics (i.e., sample size, unlabeled proportion of cases, classification base rate, and human coder reliability) influence content classification performance. The simulation indicated that the influence of sample size and unlabeled proportion on model classification performance tended to be curvilinear. In addition, base rate and human coder reliability had a strong effect on classification performance. Finally, using these results, we offer practical recommendations to psychologists on the necessary dataset characteristics to achieve valid prediction of content codes to guide researchers on the use of NLP models to replace human coders in content analysis research.

Americans' attitudes toward evolution at least partially depend on their religious or political values, and prior work has argued that knowledge of the theory plays a negligible role. But there have been no systematic, large-scale attempts to measure the public's knowledge of evolutionary theory, which means that claims about a lack of significant impact of evolution knowledge on evolution acceptance may be premature. Using a new demographically representative survey (N = 1100) that includes a detailed measure of evolution knowledge, we find that knowledge predicts level of acceptance, even after accounting for the effects of religion and politics. These results demonstrate that Americans' views on evolution are significantly influenced by their knowledge about this theory and therefore might be amenable to change.},

However, fossil fuels continue to dominate the global energy system and a sharp decline in their use must be realized to keep the temperature increase below 1.5\,\textdegree C (refs. 2\textendash 7). Here we use a global energy systems model8 to assess the amount of fossil fuels that would need to be left in the ground, regionally and globally, to allow for a 50 per cent probability of limiting warming to 1.5\,\textdegree C. By 2050, we find that nearly 60 per cent of oil and fossil methane gas, and 90 per cent of coal must remain unextracted to keep within a 1.5\,\textdegree C carbon budget. This is a large increase in the unextractable estimates for a 2\,\textdegree C carbon budget9, particularly for oil, for which an additional 25 per cent of reserves must remain unextracted. Furthermore, we estimate that oil and gas production must decline globally by 3~per cent each year until 2050. This implies that most regions must reach peak production now or during the next decade, rendering many operational and planned fossil fuel projects unviable. We probably present an underestimate of the production changes required, because a greater than 50 per cent probability of limiting warming to 1.5\,\textdegree C requires more carbon to stay in the ground and because of uncertainties around the timely deployment of negative emission technologies at scale.},

However, previous studies on this topic have been scarce. In 2019, Switzerland adopted a net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 target, which will require the use of NETs. To examine the current Swiss public perception and acceptance of five different NETs, we conducted an online survey with Swiss citizens (N = 693). By using a between-subjects design, we investigated differences in public opinion, perception, and acceptance across three of the most used frames in the scientific literature \textemdash{} technological fix, moral hazard, and climate emergency. Results showed that the public perception and acceptance of NETs does not differ between the frames. The technological fix frame best reflected participants' opinion, whereas participants perceived the moral hazard frame the least credible and the climate emergency frame the most unclear. Moreover, our findings confirm the public's unfamiliarity with NETs. We found no strong opposition, as participants indicated a moderate acceptance and a neutral evaluation of all five NETs, with afforestation standing out as the most accepted and positively evaluated NET. We conclude that, in the future, the public debate on NETs should be intensified, and the public perception should be monitored regularly to inform the development of NETs.},

Deciding on moral programming depends on the moral intensity of the ethical issue. A moral intensity dashboard for engineers can help allocate the most suitable moral authority for a particular moral programming. Technology is not capable of `doing' ethics the way humans do. This leaves forms of consequentialism and deontology as the most reasonable programming alternatives, using deontic logic as a starting point. Furthermore, it is very likely that in the more complicated settings, technology should have elements of meta ethics in its moral programming to adequately deal with scenarios that lead to conflicts in moral programming. We propose to use the calculation methods that stem from a comparative approach or the Expected Moral Value approach. All this has considerable consequences in how we should see moral programming in technology-driven ethical decision-making processes. We will therefore propose a roadmap for the moral programming of smart technology.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the use of integrated assessment models (IAMs) in climate policy and research at the global scale. Two different types of IAMs are discussed. First, there are models that focus on climate change mitigation options and climate change impacts in some detail without necessarily valuing or aggregating all possible impacts into a single measure of projected climate damages. Here they are called detailed process (DP) IAMs. A second class of IAMs are much more highly aggregated and focus on calculating carbon emissions trajectories and carbon prices that maximize global welfare. Here these models are referred to as aggregate benefit\textendash cost analysis (BCA) IAMs. Early IAMs of both types were introduced about 30 years ago and by now have been applied to many important policy and research design issues. Continual advancements in physical and economic system understanding, modeling techniques, and computational power should continue to open up many additional opportunities for using these models to provide relevant information to decision makers. While the models can be improved in many areas, much of the uncertainty that exists reflects a lack of complete scientific understanding of the systems involved rather than limitations of one or another approach to model construction and use.},

  abstract = {Mobility affords a range of benefits, but there are environmental, social and economic problems associated with current transport systems. Innovations to address these issues include novel technologies (e.g., electric and autonomous vehicles; EVs, AVs), and new business models and social practices (e.g., shared mobility). Yet, far more attention by policy-makers and researchers has been paid to the technical aspects of a low-carbon mobility transition than to social or psychological aspects, or the role of the user. In this paper, we integrate insights from the multi-level perspective on transitions and socio-psychological literature and draw on transport expert interview (N\,=\,11) data, to examine (a) what influences current attitudes and behaviours in respect of EVs and AVs, and shared mobility, and (b) how this may change in the years to come. We argue that technological change may be most compatible with the transport regime (dominated by personal car-based mobility) but potentially affords a narrower range of sustainability benefits, while mobility substitution (e.g., reducing the need to travel through tele-working or -shopping) may be most challenging for both policy-makers and publics, while potentially addressing a wider range of sustainability problems associated with the transport regime. Shared mobility options sit somewhere in between and challenge certain aspects of the regime (e.g., status associated with car ownership) while offering certain environmental, social and economic benefits. For all three areas of innovation, policy interventions need to address the needs, preferences, experiences and identities of users if they are to be effective and sustainable.},

Interestingly, however, there is currently no clear consensus on what transdisciplinarity is or how its quality can be evaluated. This paper uses three avenues to advance and clarify our understanding of transdisciplinarity. Firstly, we survey the theoretical literature and identify key characteristics used by authors in the field to distinguish transdisciplinarity from related research approaches. These characteristics are problem focus, evolving methodology and collaboration. In our discussion of these we highlight variations in description that have significance for practice. Secondly, we explore three interesting quandaries that transdisciplinary researchers face (integration, reflection and paradox) discussing how these quandaries manifest in different dimensions and their potential as both challenge and opportunity for practice. Finally, we use our synthesised characteristics and challenges to shape two alternative frameworks for evaluating the quality of TD endeavours. Our first framework is based on strategic questioning and is potentially useful to individuals seeking to improve the quality of their work. Our second framework adapts an existing quality schema to the unique challenges of transdisciplinarity and may be more appealing to those seeking to compare TD research projects.},

  abstract = {Cognitive interviewing, based on the self-report methods of Ericsson and Simon, is a key form of qualitative research that has developed over the past thirty years. The primary objective of cognitive interviewing, also known as cognitive testing, is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the survey-response process. An equally important aim is contributing to the development of best practices for writing survey questions that are well understood and that produce low levels of response error. In particular, an important applied objective is the evaluation of a particular set of questions, items, or other materials under development by questionnaire designers, to determine means for rewording, reordering, or reconceptualizing. Hence, as well as providing an empirical, psychologically oriented framework for the general study of questionnaire design, cognitive interviewing has been adopted as a 'production' mechanism for the improvement of a wide variety of survey questions, whether factual, behavioral, or attitudinal in nature. As with other methods that rely on qualitative data, cognitive interviewing has increasingly been criticized for being lax in the critical area of the development of systematic methods for data reduction, analysis, and reporting of results. Practitioners tend to conduct cognitive interviewing in varying ways, and the data coding and compilation activities undertaken are often nonstandardized and poorly described. There is a considerable need for further development--and documentation--relating not only to a description of this variation but also to providing a set of recommendations for minimal standards, if not best practices. The proposed volume endeavors to address this clear omission.},

  abstract = {This chapter has been adapted from the first two chapters of De Boeck and Wilson (2004). In this chapter we illustrate the use of item response models to analyze data resulting from the measurement of competencies. These item response models deal with data from an instrument such as a test, an inventory, an attitude scale, or a questionnaire\textemdash we will call this "test data". The main purpose of using item response models is the measurement of propensities: specifically, abilities, skills, achievement levels, traits, attitudes, etc. In standard item response modeling each item is modeled with its own set of parameters and in one way or another, the person parameters are also estimated\textemdash we will call this the "measurement" approach. In a broader approach, which does not contradict but complements the measurement approach, one might want to model how the properties of the items and the persons making the responses lead to the persons' responses\textemdash we will call this the "explanatory" approach. Understanding how the item responses are generated implies that the responses can be explained in terms of properties of items and of persons. We also take a broader statistical approach than that of standard item response models. It turns out that most extant item response models are special cases of what are called generalized linear or nonlinear mixed models. In this chapter, the perspective that is taken on these models is quite simple in its general expression (although it is not necessarily simple in how it is applied to a specific situation) and it has several advantages. We see it as being straightforward because the similarities and differences between models can be described in terms of the kinds of predictors (item properties, person properties, and interactions of item and person properties) and the kinds of weights they have, just as in the familiar regression model. Perhaps the most important feature of the broader approach is that it facilitates the implementation of the explanatory perspective described above. Additional important advantages we see are that the approach is general and therefore also flexible, and it connects psychometrics strongly to the field of statistics, so that a broader knowledge base and more literature become available.

Experimental ethics is an approach to evaluate expectations humans put into the morality of digital agents. With this work we present a personalized abstraction of the ``Trolley Problem'' evaluated in a driving simulator. The aim of the study was to assess drivers' individual attitudes in ethical decisions and derive common knowledge about how to solve such situations. In contrast to previous work, the study at hand looks at the problem from a holistic point of view, including uncertainty and accident risk (presented to subjects as their probability to survive). Furthermore, subjective scales and semi-structured interviews to determine subjects' justifications for ethical decisions complemented the setting. Our results (n=40) suggest that most drivers want their vehicles to act in an utilitarian way and opt for the more severe collision \textemdash{} even when their own probability to survive is substantially low. In addition, age and size of the injured party have a significant effect on the results. Qualitative data (interviews) indicate that the justification, in particular for decisions with the same outcome, strongly differs as most people have embodied their own moral concepts.},

For large-scale adoption, however, demand-side oriented policy measures are required, based on consumers' transport needs, values and social norms. We introduce an empirically grounded, spatially explicit, agent-based model, InnoMind (Innovation diffusion driven by changing Minds), to simulate the effects of policy interventions and social influence on consumers' transport mode preferences. The agents in this model represent individual consumers. They are calibrated based on empirically derived attributes and characteristics of survey respondents. We model agent decision-making with artificial neural networks that account for the role of emotions in information processing. We present simulations of 4 scenarios for the diffusion of EVs in the city of Berlin, Germany (3 policy scenarios and 1 base case). The results illustrate the varying effectiveness of measures in different market segments and the need for appropriate policies tailored to the heterogeneous needs of different travelers. Moreover, the simulations suggest that introducing an exclusive zone for EVs in the city would accelerate the early-phase diffusion of EVs more effectively than financial incentives only.},

It is these brain-environment interpretation and coding, storage and recall functions that provide the different mental representations used for ongoing interactions with the world.

Cognitive affective maps (CAMs) can be used for data collection, analysis and a communication medium. These roles allow the researcher to articulate individuals' deep emotions and values within a water community or network. The design and process can reveal how a community's values, beliefs and norms have changed over time and what potential exists for addressing embedded innovation barriers within a water governance context. To explore these ideas, this paper includes a brief review of the evolving cognitive affective sciences literature as the basis for the water cognition framework, a methodology description of cognitive affective mapping and discussion of results from a Canadian water efficiency community.},

Effective risk assessment and management requires understanding perceptions and beliefs of involved stakeholders, and how these beliefs give rise to actions that influence risk management decisions. Formal analyses of risk manager and stakeholder cognitions represent an important first step. Techniques for diagramming stakeholder mental models provide one tool for risk managers to better understand stakeholder beliefs and perceptions concerning risk, and to leverage this new understanding in developing risk management strategies.

  abstract = {The majority of global emissions scenarios compatible with holding global warming to less than 2\,\textdegree C depend on the large-scale use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to compensate for an overshoot of atmospheric CO2 budgets. Recent critiques have highlighted the ethical and environmental risks of this strategy and the danger of building long-term climate policy on such speculative technological scenarios emerging from integrated assessment models. Here, we critically examine both the use of BECCS in mitigation scenarios and the decision making philosophy underlying the use of integrated assessment modelling to inform climate policy. We identify a number of features of integrated assessment models that favour selection of BECCS over alternative strategies. However, we argue that the deeper issue lies in the tendency to view model outputs as objective science, capable of defining ``optimal'' goals and strategies for which climate policy should strive, rather than as exploratory tools within a broader policy development process. This model-centric decision making philosophy is highly sensitive to uncertainties in model assumptions and future trends, and tends to favour solutions that perform well within the model framework at the expense of a wider mix of strategies and values. Drawing on the principles of Robust Decision Making, we articulate the need for an alternative approach that explicitly embraces uncertainty, multiple values and diversity among stakeholders and viewpoints, and in which modelling exists in an iterative exchange with policy development rather than separate from it. Such an approach would provide more relevant and robust information to near-term policymaking, and enable an inclusive societal dialogue about the appropriate role for carbon dioxide removal within climate policy.},

Wray then considers the impact of Structure on the social sciences, on the history of science, and on the philosophy of science, where the problem of theory change has set the terms of contemporary realism/anti-realism debates. He examines Kuhn's frustrations with the Strong Programme sociologists' appropriations of his views, and debunks several popular claims about what influenced Kuhn as he wrote Structure.

It details a way of making inferences to the existence and properties of unobservable entities and states of affairs that can be given a probabilistic justification. The inferences used to establish realist claims are not a form of, and neither do they rely on, inference to the best explanation. Scientific Realism maintains that scientific theories and hypotheses refer to real entities, forces, and relations, even if one cannot examine them. But, there are those who doubt these claims. The author develops a novel way of defending Scientific Realism against a range of influential attacks. He argues that in some cases, at least, we can make probabilistically justifiable inferences from observed data to claims about unobservable, theoretical entities. He shows how this enables us to place some scientific realist claims on a firmer epistemological footing than has previously been the case. This also makes it possible to give a unified set of replies to the most common objections to Scientific Realism. The final chapters apply the developed conceptual apparatus to key cases from the history of science and from recent science. One example concerns realism with respect to atoms. Another looks at inferences from recent astronomical data to conclusions about the size and shape of those parts of the universe lying beyond that which we can observe.},

We contribute to mapping the semantics of risk based on word associations to provide insight into both universal and individual differences in the representation of risk. Specifically, we introduce a mini-snowball word association paradigm and use the tools of network and sentiment analysis to characterize the semantics of risk. We find that association-based representations not only corroborate but also extend those extracted from past survey- and text-based approaches. Crucially, we find that the semantics of risk show universal properties and individual and group differences. Most notably, while semantic clusters generalize across languages, their frequency varies systematically across demographic groups, with older and female respondents showing more negative connotations and mentioning more often certain types of activities (e.g., recreational activities) relative to younger adults and males, respectively. Our work has general implications for the measurement of risk-related constructs by suggesting that ``risk'' can mean different things to different individuals.},

Research in these areas often assumes a single underlying semantic network that is shared across individuals. Yet, recent evidence suggests that content, size, and connectivity of semantic networks are experience-dependent, implying sizable individual and age-related differences. Here, we investigate individual and age differences in the semantic networks of younger and older adults by deriving semantic networks from both fluency and similarity rating tasks. Crucially, we use a megastudy approach to obtain thousands of similarity ratings per individual to allow us to capture the characteristics of individual semantic networks. We find that older adults possess lexical networks with smaller average degree and longer path lengths relative to those of younger adults, with older adults showing less interindividual agreement and thus more unique lexical representations relative to younger adults. Furthermore, this approach shows that individual and age differences are not evenly distributed but, rather, are related to weakly connected, peripheral parts of the networks. All in all, these results reveal the interindividual differences in both the content and the structure of semantic networks that may accumulate across the life span as a function of idiosyncratic experiences.},

The results suggested that in general, a larger sample size, more indicators, a higher quality of indicators, and a larger covariate effect lead to more converged and proper replications, as well as fewer boundary parameter estimates and less parameter bias. Furthermore, interactions among these study factors demonstrated how using more or higher quality indicators, as well as larger covariate effect size, could sometimes compensate for small sample size. Including a covariate appeared to be generally beneficial, although the covariate parameters themselves showed relatively large bias. Our results provide useful information for practitioners designing an LCA study in terms of highlighting the factors that lead to better or worse performance of LCA.},

To understand what limits their performance and hinders their transition from laboratory to real-world conditions, future studies should focus on understanding the principles behind the design and operation of soft robots. Such studies should also consider the major challenges with regard to complex materials, accurate modeling, advanced control, and intelligent behaviors. As a starting point for such studies, this review provides a current overview of the field by examining the working mechanisms of advanced actuation and sensing modalities, modeling techniques, control strategies, and learning architectures for soft robots. Next, we summarize how these approaches can be applied to create sophisticated soft robots and examine their application areas. Finally, we provide future perspectives on what key challenges should be tackled first to advance soft robotics to truly add value to our society.},

  abstract = {There are scientific and technical challenges that must be addressed in developing systems that interact with humans and work along with other agents in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments where ethical concerns may arise. In such systems relationships between users and autonomous components will be driven as much by issues such as trust, responsibility, and acceptability, as technical ones such as planning and coordination. This paper provides a comprehensive review and classification of existing methods in machine ethics, resulting in delineation of specific challenges and issues. To address the identified challenges, we introduce a method that leverages the method of reflective equilibrium and the multi-coherence theory as a unifying constraint satisfaction framework to simultaneously assess multiple ethical principles and manage ethical conflicts in a context-sensitive manner.},

The robot comprises small airbags that can be inflated to provide the wearer with a feeling of being clenched. We then conducted an in-depth study of 66 adults who participated in a pain research protocol using thermal stimulation to investigate the effect of wearing the robot on pain perception and fear of injections. Pain assessment scale scores for perceived pain decreased significantly \$\$(p {$<$} 0.05)\$\$when participants wore the robot compared with the baseline condition in which the robot was not worn. In addition, the saliva test results showed a downward trend in oxytocin level when the robot provided the wearer with haptic feedback via the inflation of the internal airbags in response to the wearer's clench. Furthermore, the negative psychological state of participants, as measured using the positive and negative affect scale, improved significantly when wearing the robot. We also revealed that the salivary cortisol level, an indicator of stress, decreased significantly across all participants at the end of the experiment. In addition, participants' fear of injections was significantly improved after participation in the experiment. These results suggest that the wearable soft robot may alleviate the human perception of pain and fear in during medical treatments, such as vaccinations.},

  abstract = {Survey and longitudinal studies in the social and behavioral sciences generally contain missing data. Mean and covariance structure models play an important role in analyzing such data. Two promising methods for dealing with missing data are a direct maximum-likelihood and a two-stage approach based on the unstructured mean and covariance estimates obtained by the EM-algorithm. Typical assumptions under these two methods are ignorable nonresponse and normality of data. However, data sets in social and behavioral sciences are seldom normal, and experience with these procedures indicates that normal theory based methods for nonnormal data very often lead to incorrect model evaluations. By dropping the normal distribution assumption, we develop more accurate procedures for model inference. Based on the theory of generalized estimating equations, a way to obtain consistent standard errors of the two-stage estimates is given. The asymptotic efficiencies of different estimators are compared under various assumptions. We also propose a minimum chi-square approach and show that the estimator obtained by this approach is asymptotically at least as efficient as the two likelihood-based estimators for either normal or nonnormal data. The major contribution of this paper is that for each estimator, we give a test statistic whose asymptotic distribution is chisquare as long as the underlying sampling distribution enjoys finite fourth-order moments. We also give a characterization for each of the two likelihood ratio test statistics when the underlying distribution is nonnormal. Modifications to the likelihood ratio statistics are also given. Our working assumption is that the missing data mechanism is missing completely at random. Examples and Monte Carlo studies indicate that, for commonly encountered nonnormal distributions, the procedures developed in this paper are quite reliable even for samples with missing data that are missing at random.},

Although research across various fields relies on the HEXACO model increasingly, a comprehensive investigation of the nomological net of the HEXACO dimensions is missing entirely. Thus, it remains unclear whether each HEXACO dimension accounts for individual variation across theoretically relevant outcome criteria. We close this gap through a large-scale meta-analytic investigation, testing whether each HEXACO dimension is uniquely linked to one broad and theoretically relevant outcome domain. Results from 426 individual meta-analyses, 436 independent samples, and 3,893 effect-size estimates corroborate this unique mapping. Specifically, honesty-humility maps onto the outcome domain of exploitation, emotionality onto insecurity, extraversion onto sociality, agreeableness versus anger onto obstruction, conscientiousness onto duty, and openness to experience onto exploration. Overall, the current investigation provides a comprehensive empirical test of the (breadth of) content captured by the HEXACO dimensions and allows for a broad specification of the nomological net of the HEXACO model overall.},

Some climatologists believe that this event will cause little effect on global climate change while others insist that it will trigger ``the year without a summer'' as the Tambora eruption did in 1815. How will the Tonga volcano eruption affect global climate change? Based on the indices of past volcanic eruptions and the eruption data of El Chich\'on volcano in 1982, we use a simplified radiation equilibrium model to quantify the stratospheric aerosol radiative forcing and the change in global mean surface air temperature (Ts) caused by the Tonga volcano eruption. The results show that the global average Ts will decrease by about 0.0315\textendash 0.1118\textdegree C in the next 1\textendash 2 years. The Tonga eruption will slightly slow down the global warming in a short period of time, but it will not change the global warming trend in the long term. In addition, we propose a generalized approach for estimating the impact of future volcanic eruption on global mean Ts.},

Since increased teamwork in blockchain is conducive to the creation of high-quality knowledge products, the Chinese government appears to strongly promote diversified cooperation on blockchain technology through centralized policies. Second, machine-learning topic modeling was used to analyze the content exchanged via a collaborative network.

Yet, their availability depends on non-biological factors, including the political framework in the region of collection. Here we present Bio-Dem (www.bio-dem.surge.sh), an open-source software to explore the relationship between the availability of species occurrence records and the political framework in countries worldwide and through time. Location Global. Taxon Any. Methods Bio-Dem accesses the number of occurrence records available from countries worldwide from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (www.gbif.org) and socio-political information from these countries from the Varieties of Democracy database (www.v-dem.net) as well as information on colonial history from the Issue Correlates of War Project. Results Bio-Dem is available as a free graphical user interface web application at www.bio-dem.surge.sh. Through three interactive graphs, Bio-Dem enables users to explore the relationship between species occurrence records and countries' regime type, freedom of movement, freedom of association, gross domestic product, education length, political corruption, armed conflict and colonial history. We describe possible links of these specific political indicators with the collection and mobilization of biodiversity data. Illustrative examples and video tutorials explaining the use of Bio-Dem are available at www.bio-dem.surge.sh. Main conclusions Bio-Dem provides a user-friendly way to explore the link between socio-political variables and the availability of species occurrence records in user-selected taxa and geographic regions, and to generate hypotheses on their connection. We envision Bio-Dem as a useful tool for teachers communicating the caveats of available biodiversity data, for biodiversity scientists exploring potential spatial and temporal bias in their data, and for social scientists exploring the impact of political systems on scientific data collection and biodiversity conservation.},

This article argues that its findings are more accurate and more reliable than much of the previous work because they are based on better and more sensitive measures. The results pose a dilemma for future survey work, while reopening possibilities for social capital research.},

  abstract = {Dieses Buch ist speziell auf die Bed\"urfnisse von Anf\"angern im Fach Statistik zugeschnitten. Es eignet sich f\"ur Bachelor- und Masterstudenten aller Disziplinen, auch wenn die Beispiele ihren Schwerpunkt in den Wirtschaftswissenschaften finden. Die wesentlichen Konzepte, ihre Ideen und Umsetzung werden im Detail erkl\"art und anhand von Beispielen erl\"autert. Das Buch enth\"alt viele, meist einfache Beispiele aus der Praxis, die das Interesse der Leser wecken und die Anwendung der Methoden illustrieren sollen. Der Stil ist betont mathematisch informell, und nimmt dem Leser daher die Angst vor den ansonsten recht technisch geschriebenen Konkurrenzwerken - ohne jedoch dadurch auf eine exakte Darstellung zu verzichten. Unter anderem aus diesem Grund ist der Text auch sehr f\"ur das Selbststudium zu empfehlen.},
