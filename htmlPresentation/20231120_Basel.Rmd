speech of António Guterres at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 27):

> We are in the fight of our lives. 
And we are losing. 
Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing.   
Global temperatures keep rising.  
And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible.
We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.

## Methods for (prospective) technology assessment

possible definition: 

> research practice motivated through reflexive knowledge gain for the scientific analysis of dynamic and complex socio-technical configurations with the intention of advising


<br>
<br>
**4 fundamental approaches:**

* *classical technology assessment*: top-down, centralized approach, from experts to laypersons, aiming to predict unplanned, unanticipated negative effects after introducing an emerging technology
* *participatory technology assessment*: include the perspective of laypersons 
* *argumentative technology assessment*: focuses on the ongoing process of democratic debate and argumentation
* *constructive technology assessment*: assists the development and design of technologies while technologies are still developed

Cognitive-Affective Maps




<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Cognitive-Affective Maps

CAMs as a quantitative and qualitative research method first became popular through [Paul Thagard](https://paulthagard.com/); possible to identify and visually represent any kind of declarative knowledge:


<center>
<img src="images/CAM_example.jpg", height="450px">
</center>


`r Citet(bib, c("sendtner_kostbare_2021"))`; developed tools `r Citet(bib, c("fennCognitiveAffectiveMaps2023"))` motivated by `r Citet(bib, c("reuterBridgingTroubledWaters2022", "thagard_empathica_2010"))`


<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Cognitive-Affective Maps - theory

**What are CAMs?**

* CAMs are „conceptual structures that people use to represent important aspects of the world“
* „cognitive-affective map is a visual representation of the emotion values of a group of interconnected concepts“
  + this is how CAMs differ from semantic networks, because CAMs additionally contain emotions (valence)
  + hot cognition: emotions cannot be separated from cognitions
  
<br>
<br> 

**How are CAMs constructed?**

* the stepwise construction process of CAMs can be understood as a **multiple constraint satisfaction process**, where concepts, conditions, goals, etc. are mentally represented with the involvement of emotions
  + Concepts in the CAM are only changed or added if they correspond to the „most coherent account of what we want to understand“

<br>

`r Citet(bib, c("thagard_coherence_2000", "thagard_hot_2006", "thagard_cognitive_2021"))`



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Cognitive-Affective Maps - fundamental hypothesis 

**Hypothesis**: The generation process of CAMs is not arbitrary, but is determined by multiple processes at multiple levels, and thus CAMs from similar individuals on an identical topic exhibit systematic correlations (similar data generating process)

* can be presented by a „emergent product of interaction between networks of mental representations at the individual level and networks of social communication at the group level“


<center>
<img src="images/fundamentalHypothesis.jpg", height="250px">
</center>


> if stochasticity is ubiquitous in **complex networks**, these networks are not maximally random either; rather, they obey organization principles that make them functional




`r Citet(bib, c("bianconi_multilayer_2018", "homer-dixon_complex_2013"))`


<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Cognitive-Affective Maps - application cases

* within conceptual / qualitative studies, CAMs have been applied to depict political ideologies
*	to support conflict resolution
* to inform international climate politics
*	in quantitative studies, CAMs were used to investigate the perception of the Covid-19 pandemic
*	using a mix of qualitative and quantitative procedures, CAMs have been applied to measure the perception of emerging technologies or the success of an intervention in early child-care institutions
*	CAMs have been used in the context of agent-based modeling (Schröder & Wolf, 2017; Wolf et al., 2015)
* ...

## Data structure of CAMs

assuming the **fundamental hypothesis** (see slide 18) is true, the generation process of CAMs is not arbitrary, but bey organization principles (which could depend on study design, ...) 

<br>
A CAM (graph) is in general defined by: 
$$ G = (V, E)$$
, whereby V = set of vertices, E = set of edges. The vertices also contain emotional information (valence; *hot cognition*, *HOTCO*, ...), which leads to the following network properties:


.pull-left[

**emotional properties**
<br>
measure how the valence of individual nodes contributes to the overall CAM (Average Valence, Percentage of each node type, <span style="color:blue">Central Node Valence</span>, ...)

]

.pull-right[

**latent properties**
<br>
refer to the number of nodes, links, and their interconnectedness (Centrality, Density, Diameter, Number of Nodes, Number of Links, Triadic Closure, ...)

]


<br>
using similar terminology as `r Citet(bib, c("mansell_novel_2021", "mansell_measuring_2021"))`



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Data structure of CAMs - real time analysis

* **frontend**: visible content of the CAM is within a container for Scalable Vector Graphics
* **backend**: CAM itself as well as its concepts and connectors are Java Script classes, which define the structure for these objects
  + class definition respects the classical data model of networks; allows to use Java Script library [Cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org/)

<center>
<img src="images/SAI_AccCertainty_I.jpg", height="310px">
</center>


* if only the linear relationship (red line) would have been considered (e.g. linear regression models) we would have concluded that less certainty in the evaluation leads to a stronger subjective rejection of the technology (slightly negative relationship)
* visible in the quadratic relation (blue line) there are groups of people who report a high certainty and a low (top left corner) or high (top right corner) acceptability of SAI



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->

## the never published analysis: certainty and acceptability II
